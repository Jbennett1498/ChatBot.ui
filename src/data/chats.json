The primary mechanisms driving this impact include increased input costs for manufacturers, retaliatory tariffs harming U.S. exporters, disruptions to integrated supply chains, reduced business investment due to policy uncertainty, and potential dampening of consumer demand affecting overall economic activity. While some narrowly protected sectors or specific companies might experience short-term benefits or stability, the research overwhelmingly suggests these gains will be outweighed by broader economic harm, including reduced output, potential job losses in downstream and export-oriented industries, and a more challenging environment for overall domestic production growth.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe second term of President Donald Trump has seen a significant escalation and reshaping of U.S. trade policy, characterized by the implementation and threat of broad-based and targeted tariffs. Citing objectives such as revitalizing American manufacturing, reducing trade deficits, enhancing national security, and compelling international cooperation, the administration has deployed various tariff measures ([How Should Progressives Respond to Trump’s Tariff Threats? - Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/how-should-progressives-respond-to-trumps-tariff-threats/); [Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/); [WITA’S FRIDAY FOCUS ON TRADE – APRIL 4, 2025 - WITA](https://www.wita.org/trade-news/witas-friday-focus-on-trade-april-4-2025/)). This analysis examines the potential impact of these current tariffs on domestic U.S. production within the next 6 to 12 months, drawing exclusively from the provided research materials. It will explore the mechanisms of impact, effects on input costs, consequences of retaliation, sector-specific challenges, and implications for investment and supply chains.\n\n**Overview of Current Trump Tariffs (as of April 2025)**\n\nThe current tariff landscape is complex, involving multiple layers of duties implemented under various authorities:\n\n1.  **IEEPA Border Security/Fentanyl Tariffs (Effective Feb/March 2025):** Initial tariffs included 20% on China (up from 10% initially) and 25% on Canada and Mexico, citing national emergencies related to fentanyl and border security under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Exemptions for USMCA-compliant goods and certain energy products from Canada were later granted indefinitely ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/); [The Costs of “Liberation Day” - AAF](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-costs-of-liberation-day/); [US Tariffs on Imports from Canada, Mexico and China Take Effect - Institute for Energy Research](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/us-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china-take-effect/)).\n2.  **Reciprocal / \"Liberation Day\" Tariffs (Announced April 2, Effective April 5/9):** Citing an economic national emergency related to trade deficits, the administration announced a baseline 10% tariff on most imports, with significantly higher rates applied to specific countries based on trade balances (e.g., China: 34%, EU: 20%, Japan: 24%, Taiwan: 32%). These stack on existing duties but exclude product-specific tariffs (like steel/auto) and energy ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/); [The Impact of Trump's Tariffs: PESTLE Breakdown - PESTLE Analysis](https://pestleanalysis.com/trump-tariffs/); [The Costs of “Liberation Day” - AAF](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-costs-of-liberation-day/)). These tariffs cover approximately 80% of 2024 import values ([The Costs of “Liberation Day” - AAF](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-costs-of-liberation-day/)).\n3.  **Section 232 Tariffs (Expanded March 12):** Existing tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (raised from 10% to 25%) were expanded, ending country exemptions and adding derivative articles ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/); [Trump’s Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Set with Canadian Aluminum Imports the Most Affected - Institute for Energy Research](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/trumps-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-set-with-canadian-aluminum-imports-the-most-affected/)).\n4.  **Section 232 Auto Tariffs (Announced March 26, Effective April 3):** 25% tariffs on autos and certain auto parts were announced, with exemptions for US-based content from Canada/Mexico ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/); [Trump auto tariffs all pain, no gain for consumers - Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://cei.org/news_releases/trump-auto-tariffs-all-pain-no-gain-for-consumers/)).\n5.  **Other Threatened/Investigated Tariffs:** Tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, lumber, and agricultural products have been threatened or are under investigation ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/)).\n\nCollectively, these measures raise the average U.S. tariff rate from 2.5% in 2024 to an estimated 16.5%, the highest since 1937 ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)). The Tax Foundation estimates these tariffs (excluding retaliation) will reduce long-run GDP by 0.7% ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)). J.P. Morgan Research estimates the tariffs announced through March 14 would reduce 2025 real GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points, forecasting 1.6% growth for the year ([US Tariffs: What’s the Impact? | J.P. Morgan Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)). The sweeping April 2 tariffs are estimated to impose an additional 0.4% reduction in GDP ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)).\n\n**Mechanisms of Impact on Domestic Production**\n\nTariffs affect domestic production through several interconnected channels identified in the research:\n\n1.  **Increased Input Costs:** Tariffs raise the price of imported raw materials, intermediate goods, and components used by U.S. manufacturers. This directly increases production costs ([How Will Trump’s Universal and China Tariffs Impact the Economy? - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/); [Time (or Buying American) Won't Erase the Economic Harm of Higher Tariffs - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-prices-long-term-effects/)). Businesses must either absorb these costs (reducing profits and potentially investment) or pass them onto customers (potentially reducing demand). Research indicates near-complete pass-through of tariffs to U.S. import prices occurred during the 2018-2019 trade war ([The Price of Patriotism: How Tariffs will Impact US Consumers - WITA](https://www.wita.org/blogs/price-of-patriotism/); [Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/)).\n2.  **Shift in Demand (Intended Effect):** Tariffs aim to make imported goods less attractive, encouraging consumers and businesses to switch to domestically produced alternatives, thus boosting domestic production ([How Will Trump’s Universal and China Tariffs Impact the Economy? - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/); [A Progressive Explainer on Tariffs - Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/article/a-progressive-explainer-on-tariffs/)).

Here's what it means for the Canadian economy. - Public Policy Forum](https://ppforum.ca/policy-speaking/what-tariffs-could-mean-for-the-canadian-economy/)). Furthermore, potential dollar appreciation resulting from tariffs can make U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, further hurting export-oriented producers ([How Will President Trump’s Tariffs Affect the Value of the Dollar? - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-us-dollar-currency-appreciation/)).\n4.  **Foreign Retaliation:** Trading partners often respond with retaliatory tariffs targeting U.S. exports, directly reducing demand for goods produced in the U.S. for foreign markets ([How Will Trump’s Universal and China Tariffs Impact the Economy? - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/); [Tariffs Will Destroy the Best Cure for the Trade Deficit - WITA](https://www.wita.org/blogs/tariffs-destroy-cure-trade-deficit/)). This is particularly damaging for sectors like agriculture.\n5.  **Economic Uncertainty:** The imposition of broad and shifting tariffs creates uncertainty for businesses, potentially chilling investment, hindering long-term planning, and disrupting established supply chains ([Economists Agree: Trump Is Wrong on Tariffs - The Century Foundation](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/economists-agree-trump-is-wrong-on-tariffs/); [Tariffs on all imports would create chaos for business - The Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/tariffs-on-all-imports-would-create-chaos-for-business/)). J.P. Morgan research notes that heightened trade policy uncertainty weighs on capital spending ([US Tariffs: What’s the Impact? | J.P. Morgan Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)).\n\n**Impact on Input Costs and Downstream Industries**\n\nA major anticipated impact in the next 6-12 months is the rise in costs for U.S. producers reliant on imported inputs.\n\n*   **Steel and Aluminum:** The expanded 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, including the removal of exemptions, directly increase costs for major consuming industries like automotive, construction, beverages, and machinery ([Tariffs on steel and aluminum will raise prices and hurt American manufacturing: CEI analysis - Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://cei.org/news_releases/tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-will-raise-prices-and-hurt-american-manufacturing-cei-analysis/); [Post- “Liberation Day” Edition: Liberation From Global Trade - AAF](https://www.americanactionforum.org/shipment/post-liberation-day-edition-liberation-from-global-trade/)). During Trump's first term, steel and aluminum tariffs led to a $3.4 billion production decrease in downstream industries, outweighing the $2.8 billion increase in the protected sectors ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/)). Ford and GM cited higher metal prices from first-term tariffs as reasons for slashing profit forecasts in 2018 ([The Price of Patriotism: How Tariffs will Impact US Consumers - WITA](https://www.wita.org/blogs/price-of-patriotism/)).

The U.S. is heavily import-reliant for many minerals (e.g., 100% for gallium, graphite; 76% for cobalt). Tariffs on countries like Norway (cobalt), Jamaica (bauxite), and Chile (lithium) threaten supply chains for EV batteries and other technologies ([Trump Announces 10% Baseline for Global Tariffs, But Excludes Most Energy - Institute for Energy Research](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/trump-announces-10-baseline-for-global-tariffs-but-excludes-most-energy/)).

This contrasts with the broader industry trend where many brands rely on imports.\n*   **Washing Machines:** First-term tariffs supported about 1,800 factory jobs but at a very high cost to consumers ($800,000 per job) and led to price increases for both imported and domestically produced machines (and even dryers) ([Time (or Buying American) Won't Erase the Economic Harm of Higher Tariffs - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-prices-long-term-effects/); [The Price of Patriotism: How Tariffs will Impact US Consumers - WITA](https://www.wita.org/blogs/price-of-patriotism/)).\n\nThe research suggests that tariffs tend to redistribute economic activity rather than create net growth, shifting resources towards protected, often less efficient, sectors at the expense of others ([How Will Trump’s Universal and China Tariffs Impact the Economy? - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/); [Time (or Buying American) Won't Erase the Economic Harm of Higher Tariffs - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-prices-long-term-effects/)).\n\n**Impact of Retaliation on Export-Oriented Production**\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners pose a significant threat to U.S. domestic production geared towards export markets, particularly in the next 6-12 months as these measures take effect and potentially escalate.\n\n*   **Magnitude:** As of April 4, 2025, China, Canada, and the EU have announced or imposed retaliatory tariffs affecting an estimated $330 billion of U.S. exports ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)).

Tariffs could raise costs, disrupt production, and potentially slow innovation ([The Costs of “Liberation Day” - AAF](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-costs-of-liberation-day/)).\n*   **Pharmaceuticals:** Tariffs may incentivize onshoring of high-margin, brand-name drug manufacturing but are unlikely to do so for low-margin generic drugs (which constitute 90% of volume). Tariff pressure could lead to generic drug shortages or quality issues in the near term ([Will pharmaceutical tariffs achieve their goals? - Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/pharmaceutical-tariffs-how-they-play-out/)).\n*   **Consumer Goods (Toys, Apparel, etc.):** Industries heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China and Southeast Asia, face rising costs. While some larger companies have been diversifying production away from China for years, smaller companies have fewer options and may have to absorb costs or raise prices ([Suppliers Prepare for Potential Tariffs - Licensing International](https://licensinginternational.org/news/suppliers-prepare-for-potential-tariffs/); [Toy Makers Consider Moving Production to Avoid Tariffs - Pymnts](https://www.pymnts.com/supply-chain/2025/toy-makers-consider-moving-production-to-avoid-tariffs/)).\n\n**Investment, Reshoring, and Supply Chain Adjustments (Next 6-12 Months)**\n\nThe tariff environment is forcing companies to re-evaluate their supply chains, but significant shifts in domestic production face near-term hurdles.\n\n*   **Uncertainty and Investment:** The chaotic nature and unpredictability of tariff implementation create significant uncertainty, deterring investment ([Economists Agree: Trump Is Wrong on Tariffs - The Century Foundation](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/economists-agree-trump-is-wrong-on-tariffs/); [Tariffs on all imports would create chaos for business - The Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/tariffs-on-all-imports-would-create-chaos-for-business/)). J.P. Morgan notes heightened trade policy uncertainty weighs on capital spending ([US Tariffs: What’s the Impact? | J.P. Morgan Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)). Businesses are scrambling to renegotiate contracts, reconfigure supply chains, and lobby for exemptions, diverting resources from core operations ([Tariffs on all imports would create chaos for business - The Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/tariffs-on-all-imports-would-create-chaos-for-business/)).\n*   **Supply Chain Diversification:** Companies across sectors (toys, fashion, housewares) have been gradually moving production away from China, often to Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, or India ([Suppliers Prepare for Potential Tariffs - Licensing International](https://licensinginternational.org/news/suppliers-prepare-for-potential-tariffs/); [How U.S. tariffs might impact countries of Latin America and the Caribbean - International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/blog/how-us-tariffs-might-impact-countries-of-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/)). The new tariffs, including high rates on these alternative locations (e.g., Vietnam 46%), accelerate this trend but also complicate it ([The Impact of Trump's Tariffs: PESTLE Breakdown - PESTLE Analysis](https://pestleanalysis.com/trump-tariffs/)). Mexico is seen as a potential beneficiary of nearshoring, despite facing tariffs ([Navigating uncertainty: The impact of Trump's proposed tariffs on ...](https://www.thescxchange.com/finance-strategy/plan/navigating-uncertainty-the-impact-of-trump-s-proposed-tariffs-on-global-supply-chains)).

Higher labor costs, replicating complex supplier ecosystems, and the fact that tariffs also raise the cost of imported machinery and components needed for new factories present significant barriers ([Debunking the Three Best Arguments for Tariffs - Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://cei.org/opeds_articles/debunking-the-three-best-arguments-for-tariffs/); [Navigating uncertainty: The impact of Trump's proposed tariffs on ...](https://www.thescxchange.com/finance-strategy/plan/navigating-uncertainty-the-impact-of-trump-s-proposed-tariffs-on-global-supply-chains)). Building new production lines can take years ([Time (or Buying American) Won't Erase the Economic Harm of Higher Tariffs - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-prices-long-term-effects/)).\n\n**Overall Economic Outlook and Production Environment (6-12 Months)**\n\nThe confluence of these factors points towards a challenging environment for domestic production growth in the coming months.\n\n*   **Economic Slowdown/Recession Risk:** Multiple sources forecast negative impacts on GDP growth ([Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - WITA](https://www.wita.org/atp-research/tracking-impact-trump-tariffs/); [Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)).

Morgan Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)). Fitch Ratings also warned of recession risk ([The Impact of Trump's Tariffs: PESTLE Breakdown - PESTLE Analysis](https://pestleanalysis.com/trump-tariffs/)). TD Economics projected that tariffs remaining in place for 5-6 months could tip the Canadian economy into recession and cause the U.S. economy to \"grind to a halt\" ([Tariffs take effect. Here's what it means for the Canadian economy. - Public Policy Forum](https://ppforum.ca/policy-speaking/what-tariffs-could-mean-for-the-canadian-economy/)). Border regions are already reportedly experiencing recessionary conditions ([Here Are the Places Where the Recession Has Already Begun](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/recession-tariffs-canada-trump/682297/?utm_source=openai)).\n*   **Inflationary Pressures:** Tariffs are widely expected to increase costs for businesses and consumers, contributing to inflation ([Economists Agree: Trump Is Wrong on Tariffs - The Century Foundation](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/economists-agree-trump-is-wrong-on-tariffs/); [What are tariffs and what do they mean for Canada? - Public Policy Forum](https://ppforum.ca/policy-speaking/what-are-tariffs-and-what-do-they-mean-for-canada/)). J.P. Morgan estimates the April 2 tariffs could boost PCE prices by 1-1.5% in 2025 ([US Tariffs: What’s the Impact? | J.P. Morgan Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)). This can reduce consumer purchasing power and demand, indirectly affecting production.\n*   **Short-Term Pain:** Even proponents acknowledge potential short-term negative consequences. President Trump himself noted there might be \"short-term pain\" ([Time (or Buying American) Won't Erase the Economic Harm of Higher Tariffs - Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-prices-long-term-effects/); [How Should Progressives Respond to Trump’s Tariff Threats? - Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/how-should-progressives-respond-to-trumps-tariff-threats/)), and Treasury Secretary Bessant suggested tariffs would raise prices now to achieve longer-term goals ([Trump’s tariffs are not going over well with his base - Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-tariffs-are-not-going-over-well-with-his-base/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe research materials provided strongly suggest that the current Trump administration tariffs will negatively impact domestic U.S. production over the next 6 to 12 months. Increased costs for imported inputs will squeeze margins and raise prices for manufacturers across various sectors, notably automotive, construction, and energy. Retaliatory tariffs from key trading partners like China, Canada, and the EU will reduce demand for U.S. exports, particularly harming agricultural producers and manufacturers reliant on foreign markets. While some domestic firms in protected industries may see isolated benefits, these are unlikely to offset the broader damage caused by higher costs, disrupted supply chains, reduced competitiveness, and heightened economic uncertainty that discourages investment. The cumulative effect points towards a contractionary pressure on U.S. production activity in the short-to-medium term, potentially contributing to slower economic growth or even recessionary conditions in certain regions or sectors."

We are, in particular, providing comment on Item 10, Improving Access—Enhancing Rules on Internal Coverage Criteria.   At Stanford Biodesign, we believe that a disciplined approach to innovation across the continuum of care is the key to solving healthcare challenges in the U.S. and across the globe. For more than two decades, we’ve demonstrated that innovation can be taught, learned, practiced, and perfected. The Biodesign innovation process has been adopted by more than 100 universities and training programs around the world. Our trainees learn to observe patient needs and care delivery to identify the right opportunities for transformative impact. Over 13 million people have been helped by technologies invented during Stanford Biodesign training.   With our position at the metaphorical and physical start line for healthcare innovation, we have observed the often decade-long journey for a novel health technology to become the standard of care treatment for a disease state. At the Stanford Biodesign Policy Program, we have focused our research on qualitative and quantitative evidence that elucidates this process from FDA authorization through clinical evidence generation to commercial viability with an emphasis on how federal policy balances speed and risk. In 2023, we published “Time From Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to Medicare Coverage for Novel Technologies.”1 The composite endpoint of Medicare coverage was defined as the achievement of a National Coverage Determination (NCD), 3 or more Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), or a permanent code. Fewer than 50% of the 64 technologies profiled achieved an endpoint, and the average time to coverage was at least 5.7 years. Innovators commonly refer to the time between FDA authorization and widespread coverage as the “valley of death” because many companies fail to generate enough revenue or raise enough capital to stay in business while   318 Campus Drive Room E100 Stanford, CA 94305 biodesign.stanford.edu  \n    \nnavigating the requirements to establish coding, coverage and payment. It is these novel technologies that we will focus on for our comments.    Novel technologies support a new procedure, diagnostic test or intervention. They may be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through one of multiple review pathways and may have been selected for prioritized FDA reviewer focus by being selected for FDA Breakthrough Device Designation. Upon receiving FDA authorization, the manufacturer is granted access to commercial distribution in the US. However, the broad uptake of a novel technology depends on establishing coding, payment, and coverage, as well as the support of specialty medical societies and individual physicians who adopt the technology into their practice. Establishing coding, coverage and payment is far more complex than achieving FDA authorization. It requires building sufficient clinical evidence to convince physicians, specialty societies, healthcare institutions, and payers of the safety, efficacy, and value of the novel technology related to specific patient populations. No one set of standards apply, and no single organization is wholly responsible for the decision-making. The American Medical Association (AMA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) share responsibility for assigning codes. CMS plays an active role in the coverage of novel technology through the NCD and LCD processes. Each commercial payer also uses a health technology assessment process for coverage policies and a specific administrative process for requesting modification or reevaluation. We applaud the Centers’ efforts through the April 2023 final rule, the February 2024 HPMS memo, and the current proposed rulemaking to clarify the obligations of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to cover basic benefits and use coverage criteria in a way that aligns with Traditional Medicare. Section 1852 of the Social Security Act and Sections 422.100 and 422.101 of the Code of Federal Regulations require MA organizations to furnish all items and services for which benefits are available under Parts A and B of Medicare. In addition, MA plans are also allowed to implement utilization management programs, prior authorization, and provider network restrictions to the benefits that Medicare beneficiaries receive. Your goal with the new provisions is to “build upon and enhance the regulations from the April 2023 final rule.” CMS has specifically solicited comments on three elements of internal coverage criteria in the proposed rulemaking, including: 1. “on replacing the existing requirement at § 422.101(b)(6)(i)(A) […] with a requirement that the MA organization must demonstrate through evidence that the additional criteria explicitly support patient safety, and on whether this approach is clearer than the current standard and how we could define patient safety in a way that MA organizations understand how to comply with the rule”. Additional internal coverage criteria must be based on clinical evidence. Medicare LCD and NCDs are developed using an extensive and public process for the development of   318 Campus Drive Room E100 Stanford, CA 94305 biodesign.stanford.edu  \n    \nthe coverage policy. This solicited comment seeks to explore a situation in which the internal coverage criteria do not fall within the category explicitly prohibited in the proposed §§ 422.101(b)(6)(iv)(A) and (B), and that the LCD or NCD developed by Medicare was insufficient to describe an additional safety risk applicable to the Medicare beneficiary. Studies have shown that Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries do not differ significantly in terms of race, ethnicity, income, or chronic conditions when Special Needs Plans are excluded from analysis.2 It is challenging, then, to envision a situation where the Medicare coverage determination did not appropriately take into account an element of patient safety. In order to demonstrate patient safety as a reason for an internal coverage criteria, MA plans should publish a clinical evidence review that cites specific examples of adverse events or negative healthcare outcomes that justify a restriction in coverage. These evidence reviews should be in context relative to the available alternative therapies this subgroup of patients may or may not have, as risk/benefit is a relative framework and not absolute.  Such transparency would help clinicians understand the patient population where technology use is best supported by evidence (and thus prevent administrative burdens of delays and denials), help companies design the most appropriate studies for continuing evidence development, and provide visibility to beneficiaries. 2. “on whether there are other prohibitions on internal coverage criteria that CMS should consider that support and promote access to medically necessary care in the MA program.” Under the statutory mandates of the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016,3 CMS has advanced policies to streamline and speed the LCD process. These initiatives included a revised, transparent, and public process for developing LCD, relocation of codes, and specific instructions to retire Non-coverage LCDs for Category III codes.4 According to the revised LCD process, the MACs must analyze the evidence and provide a rationale for any changes in coverage. The Local Coverage Determination (LCD) Process Modernization Qs \u0026 As5 stated, “MACs must follow the established LCD process when developing LCDs that articulate when an item/service/technology is considered reasonable and necessary (R \u0026 N) or use claim by claim medical record review to determine R \u0026 N coverage.” The new proposed statements in §§ 422.101.6(iii) and (iv) clarify the circumstances under which an MA plan can apply internal coverage criteria. However, they do not explicitly require MA plans to evaluate Category III codes on a claim-by-claim basis. We recommend additional explicit language that ensures MA plans use claim-by-claim evaluation of new technologies where no Medicare LCD or NCD exists.   318 Campus Drive Room E100 Stanford, CA 94305 biodesign.stanford.edu  \n    \nWhy? We can imagine a future where immediate action on the part of the MA plan results in a non-coverage policy rapidly following the effective date of the new code. An extremely short window between the creation of a code and the publication of a non-coverage policy cripples physicians who wish to evaluate the technology or replicate clinical results through independent clinical trials and stymies product developers from collecting real-world effectiveness data or assessing health economic outcomes – all of which are evidence used in a typical health technology assessment for writing coverage policies. This situation sets up a Catch-22 in which new technology can’t achieve coverage because sufficient utilization outside of clinical studies cannot be demonstrated.  Rapid publication of internal coverage criteria stating that a technology is unproven, experimental, or investigational leads to inequitable beneficiary access to emerging technologies that use Category III codes as a route to commercialization. The Traditional Medicare beneficiary can access the new technology through claim-by-claim medical record review until an LCD or NCD has been developed, while the MA beneficiary will face an immediate denial of coverage. For example, the United Healthcare (UHC) Medical Advantage Medical Policy MMP043.406 titled Category III CPT Codes lists ninety-nine Category III codes. Sixty-five (65%) codes do not have applicable NCD or LCD coverage criteria, and are listed with the conclusion “Unproven” with a hyperlink to a reference UHC commercial policy. For seven additional codes (7%), an LCD exists for 1 or 2 MACs, and the UHC commercial policy is linked for states and territories where no LCD exists.  In contrast, under a claim-by-claim scenario, the physician is responsible for appropriately documenting the patient’s condition and providing a justification for how the use of the technology meets the reasonable and necessary threshold for coverage. Physicians are also responsible for informing the patient, through an Advanced Beneficiary Notice, that Medicare may not cover the cost of the claim. These administrative steps ensure that protections exist for Medicare beneficiaries and support shared decision-making with physicians about whether using a new technology is the right next step in their treatment plan. Equivalent administrative steps should be available to MA plan beneficiaries and their physicians. 3.  “on whether CMS should require a specific format for the information posted on the MA organization website and whether a standard template for the posted information would be helpful.” We agree that a specific format for the information posted on the MA organization website would be helpful. Coverage policy formats, titles, and organizational schema vary across plan administrators, and the lack of standards increases the administrative burden of verifying coverage eligibility. Additionally, Item 2 (Definition of Internal   318 Campus Drive Room E100 Stanford, CA 94305 biodesign.stanford.edu  \n    \nCoverage Criteria) called for MA plans to explicitly describe each internal coverage criteria that would apply to a coverage decision. Thus, listing internal coverage criteria and providing references to the commercial policy in a table format alongside the applicable Medicare NCD or LCD will facilitate side-by-side comparison. The UHC MA coverage policy for technologies utilizing Category III codes referenced above demonstrates an example of clarified formatting. A table of applicable coverage has been created with a column to indicate, for each code, if a Medicare NCD or LCD(s) exists and which UHC coverage policy is applicable. Such an update makes coverage policies immediately understandable and accessible to physicians, coding and billing specialists, and beneficiaries. In addition, using a pre-specified format for the information provided by MA plans will ensure that this emerging technology, like LLMs, appropriately accesses and compiles results. Currently, LLMs are not well trained on table-based data sets, but the pace of innovation in this space suggests that models will rapidly advance.   In conclusion, we recommend MA plans should publish a clinical evidence review that cites specific examples of adverse events or negative healthcare outcomes that justify a restriction in coverage, and recommend explicit language be added that ensures MA plans use claim-by-claim evaluation of new technologies. We agree that a specific format for the information posted on the MA organization website would be helpful.  Thank you for your consideration of these public comments.

We do this by \ninvesting in the most promising research, advocating for progress by working with government \nto address issues that impact the T1D community, and helping educate and empower individuals \nfacing this condition.  \nABOUT TYPE 1 DIABETES  \nType 1 diabetes (“T1D”) is an autoimmune disease that strikes people suddenly and is fatal if not \nproperly managed with insulin. People with T1D must continuously balance their blood sugar, \nwhich can be impacted by food, exercise, stress, sickness, and oth er external factors. People with \nT1D manage their blood sugar by taking insulin through multiple daily injections or the use of \ninsulin pumps, which require maintenance 24 hours a day, every day to stay alive. While insulin \nis essential to the livelihood o f people with T1D, too much insulin can result in severe \nhypoglycemic events such as loss of consciousness, seizures, and death. However, not taking \nenough insulin can cause severe complications , such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), coma, and \nlong-term damage to the kidneys, heart, eyes, and nervous system. Even if people with T1D \nuphold a rigorous routine, blood sugar levels are unpredictable and can negatively impact \ncognition, mood, sleep, and the overall quality of life.  \nDespite advances in technology, many people with T1D still struggle to achieve recommended \nHbA1c levels  that reduce the risk of diabetes related complications . People with T1D and those \n2 \n at risk of developing it, desperately need continued access to breakthrough therapies designed to \ntreat and help manage this difficult disease to prevent its life -threatening complications.  \nCOMMENTS ON FDA’ S DRAFT GUIDANCE DOCUMENT  \nThe interests of the T1D community are best served by an FDA that exhibits thorough and \nrigorous regulatory science and  engages in reasonable regulation that supports efficient pathways \nin product development  and ensures a level playing field for the diverse industries that it \nregulates. In reviewing the draft guidance document, it is not readily apparent (1) what issues \nFDA has encountered that warrants issuance of this particular draft guidance document and (2) \nhow the guidance document , that only applies to premarket submissions subject of C enter for \nDrug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research \n(CBER)  led review , is consistent with FDA’s device authorities and the Center for Devices and \nRadiological Health (CDRH) application of the authorities. It is from this overall perspective  that \nwe offer the following comments:  \n1. The draft guidance suggests that FDA may be expanding its regulatory authority \nover devices and device constituent parts of CDER -led and CBER -led combination \nproducts beyond that associated with all other medical devices.  \nBreak through T1D is familiar with CDRH regulation of devices having collaborated with CDRH \nfor many years on the regulation of numerous devices and public health issues affecting the T1D \ncommunity. As required by 21 CFR § 820.30., CDRH has focused its efforts on promulgating \nspecial controls for select devices and on ensuring that class II and class III device manufacturers \nhave design control procedures in place . The draft guidance seems to expand and deepen FDA’s \nrole in the review of a narrow slice of devices  to create additional regulatory burden on their \nmanufacturers ; beyond that which CDRH regulated device  manufacturers are subject.  \nAs is well recognized , the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 amended the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) to give FDA the explicit authority  to regulate medical devices \nand more specifically to promulgate performance standards  for class II devices. Conceptually, \nthis authority allowed the agency t o establish a baseline standard for safe and effective \nperformance for class II devices and to identify elements of device design  that were critical to \nmeeting an applicable mandatory performance  standard . Congress again amended the FDCA \nthrough enactment of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) to replace perfo rmance \nstandards  with special controls , thereby maintaining FDA’s existing authority and substantially \nbroadening it for class II devices. Since enactment of SMDA, FDA established one class II \nperformance standard  (i.e., a mandatory performance standard for electrode lead wires and \npatient cables1), and has selectively established special controls  for a number of class II devices . \nIn establishing special controls, C DRH has  avoided dictat ing specific elements of device design , \nchoosing rather to require that safety concerns associated with the generic type  of device2 be \naddress ed broadly such as by requiring sterility, biocompatibility, and electrical safety , to name \nonly on a few .  \n \n1 21 CFR § 898 – Performance Standard for electrode lead wires and patient cables.  \n2 21 CFR § 860.3(i)  3 \n Based on  our experience with medical d evice development and regulation, it seems that efforts to \ninfluence device design may be best accomplished through promulgation of s pecial controls , to \ninclude mandatory performance standards,  rather than through an issuance of non -binding \nguidance. This approach can address concerns associated with entire generic types of class II \ndevices  while affording interested parties an opportunity to participate in the process . Combine \nthis with the possibility of reclassif ying any class I generic device t ype of concern into class II \nand a very large portion of devices of concern can be fairly and equitably regulated.  Class III \ndevices should be o f very little concern given that premarket approval represents the agency’s \nhighest standard for ensuring a device’s safety and effectiveness  and involves a close \nexamination of manufacturing processes .   \n2. The proposed approach, as expressed in the draft guidance document , is likely to \ncreate an unlevel playing field for manufacture rs of drug and biologic al product \ndelivery devices,  resulting in a disincentive  to develop them for use in combination \nproducts.  \nThe title of the draft guidance document refers to devices intended to deliver drugs and \nbiological products , a fairly broad subset of medical devices . However, the scope of the guidance \ndocument limit s its applicability and impact to devices and device constituent parts of “CDER -\nled and CBER -led combination products ”, an extremely narrow subset of medical devices . While \nthe scope of the draft guidance document is narrow , its impact is both broad and substantial  with \na high potential to adversely  affect devices both inside and outside the designated scope.  \nDevices that fall within the scope of the draft guidance document appear to be subject to greater \nregulatory scrutiny and burden than all other drug and biological product delivery devices \nregulated by CDRH, regardless of device classification. As the draft document clearly \nacknowledges , the requirements for FDA market authorization of medical devices vary \ndepending on the path to market ( e.g., PMA, 510(k) or de novo  classification) with the specific \npath dictated by the device’s regulatory classification. As pointed ou t in the draft document , \nFDA ’s authority to require the data and information suggested by the draft varies depending on \nthe particular path to market, with PMAs for class III devices getting more deeply into \nmanufacturing and 510(k)s  and de novo  classification requests  for class I and II devices almost \nnever considering compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices ( CGMPs).  \nBreakthrough T1D’s concern is that requiring manufacture rs of drug and biological product \ndelivery devices that are the subjects of CDER -led and CBER -led marketing applications  for \ncombination products to provide FDA with data and information on design outputs , specifically \nthe subset referred to as essential drug delivery  output s (EDDO s), will serve as a deterrent to \ndevice manufacturers collaborating with drug and biological product companies and very likely \nnegatively impact the development of devices in CDER -led and CBER -led combination \nproducts.   \nWith the vast majority of drug and biological product delivery devices regulated by CDRH, care \nmust also be exercised to ensure that any guidance document  that is issued does not negatively \nand disproportionately impact the development of a relatively small , but critical, universe of \ncombination products administratively assigned to CDER and C BER for lead review. Likewise, \nregulating even a small number of devices in combination products administratively assigned to 4 \n CDER and C BER for lead review  differently than CDRH reviewed devices can call into question \nwhy the scope of the guidance is not expanded to all drug and biological product delivery \ndevices.  If this were to occur, the impact of the guidance would be even more substantial.  \n3. Many a spects of the draft guidance document are confusing and there are voids that \nlimit one’s  ability to interpret the guidance and assess its actual impact. Rather than \ncritically assess every aspect of the draft, we have limited our comments to three \nbroad areas that illustrate and substantiate our position . \n \na. All medical d evices are subject to FDA classification procedures with the final class dictating \nthe regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of device safety and \neffectiveness . The draft guidance document , however, does not mention the classification  of \nthe devices , and device constituent parts , that are the subject of the CDER -led and CBER -led \ncombination products submissions. Without knowing a device’s classification, it is \nimpossible to determine the regulatory controls that are appropriate and required.  \n  \nb. While t he draft guidance document references IDEs, 510(k)s, de novo  classification requests , \nand PMAs , as well as the differences in content requirements for each of these submission \ntypes, there is no information that suggests what types of submissions may be the subject of \nCDER -led and CBER -led review. In fact, among the examples in the appendices, there are no \nreferences to premarket submission types. While one can assume that any of the document \ntypes may be subject to CDER -led and CBER -led review , or perhaps that the device or \ndevice constituent part may be reviewed as part of a drug or biological product premarket \nsubmission, it would be beneficial if the guidance document illustrated exactly how the \nreview s of targeted devices may unfold.  \n \nc. The draft guidance refers to both investigational device exemptions (IDEs) and \ninvestigational new drug applications (INDs) for target ed devices but  does not address which \none is appropriate for any given set of circumstances . In regard to the information required to \nbe provide d in an investigational application , the draft guidance is very confusing. Not only \nis there no information that clarif ies when and under what circumstances an IDE or IND may \nbe appropriate , the discussion suggests that independent of whether the device or device \nconstituent part is the subject of an IDE and IND, the requirements for submission content \nrelevant to EDDOs should be approached in the same manner. The draft goes so far as to say \nthat “ For any required IDE and IND applications for drug delivery devices, requirements for \nsubmission content relevant to EDDOs include, but are not limited to the following  …” \nwhere it goes on to cite sections of the IDE and IND regulations as if they a re synonymous , \nwhich they are not . For example, t here is no mention of the possibility that a targeted drug \ndelivery device could be subject to the “abbreviated requirements”  found in the IDE \nregulation3. This could suggest that the Agency believe s there can be no such thing as a “non -\nsignificant risk”  drug and biological product delivery device  in a CDER -led or CBER -led \ncombination product , however, from the draft document one simply cannot tell .     \n \n3 See 21 CFR § 812.2(b)  5 \n Breakthrough T1D very much appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the draft \nguidance document. We believe the  draft guidance is substantially lacking clarity and has the \npotential to adverse ly impact the development of much needed devices intended to deliver drugs \nand biological products , many of which may be assigned administratively to CDER and CBER \nas a lead center for review . We urge FDA to carefully  consider all comments submitted , schedule \nan open public workshop to discuss the basis for the guidance and the best way to move forward , \nand promptly update the draft accordingly.   \nThank you very much for your consideration of these comments. If you have questions, please \ndo not hesitate to contact Stephen Karpen , Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs for Breakthrough \nT1D at SKarpen@BreakthroughT1D.org  or 202-465-4122 . \n",

Spread over all 50 states, our industry is responsible for nearly 2 million jobs in the U.S., including both direct and indirect employment at an average annual salary of $88,096-49% higher than the average across all industries and 18% higher than the corresponding premium of all manufacturing jobs. Of the nearly 15,000 medtech facilities nationwide, 94% were small businesses that employed fewer than 100 employees. The U.S. medical technology industry generates approximately $200 billion in annual domestic production output.\nThe medical technology industry is a manufacturing success story. Our industry is a world leader, with homegrown R\u0026D, domestic manufacturing in communities large and small and worldwide exports of American-made products. U.S. medtech has a robust domestic industrial manufacturing and supply chain footprint. Over two-thirds of all medical technology used in the U.S. is manufactured domestically (69% or $153 billion in domestic sales). The remaining one-third ($61 billion) is imported from the European Union (10.4% or $23 billion), Mexico (5.6% or $12 Billion) and China (3.8% or $8.5 billion). American companies represent about 40 percent of the roughly $500 billion global market for medical devices1 and provide patients access to the highest quality medical devices and diagnostics in 195 countries.\nMedical technology, a complex and heterogeneous industry, ranges from basic consumables such as gloves and catheters to highly sophisticated equipment such as MRI and pacemakers to diagnose, treat and support a wide range of clinical conditions. Medical devices are used in diverse settings by physicians and technicians in hospitals, in nursing homes and at home. These technologies - that save and improve lives - span a range of care areas including critical care/trauma, cardiovascular, cancer, orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics. And while there is no definitive resource providing the exact numbers of medical devices on the market, in 2017 FDA reported that it oversees approximately 175,000 medical devices on the U.S. market, more than 18,000 medical device manufacturers, and more than 25,000 medical device facilities worldwide.\nGeneral Comments:\n. AdvaMed agrees with the structure of APEC \"Because the Partnership will build on, and coexist with, existing U.S trade agreements, its work should not detract from or unnecessarily duplicate work that is taking place in the committees of existing U.S trade agreements, including free trade agreements, trade and investment framework agreements, and other similar agreements.\"\n. Within this context, we welcome APEP initiatives that can pave the way toward eventual geographic expansion of high-standard trade commitments as they were negotiated\nPage 2 of 7\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nwithin the U.S .- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - recognizing that these provisions level the playing field for U.S. industry and workers.\n· Until time as such high-standard trade commitments can be expanded, we encourage the APEP partners to pursue the implementation of voluntary initiatives that can facilitate APEP objectives on trade, supply chain, health, et al, including reducing trade barriers in all of their forms be they tariff, non-tariff, at the border, behind the border, etc.\n· AdvaMed supports APEP work with its partner countries of United States, Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Uruguay and encourage its expansion to include Brazil, Argentina and other countries in the region.\n· With a view to maximizing synergies and economizing resources, we encourage continued APEP coordination - programmatic and logistical - with other regional fora including the Summit of the Americas process, Meetings of the IDB and Americas Business Dialogue (ABD), Americas RISE for Health, EHA et al.\n. AdvMed recommends that the U.S. government focus its efforts under APEP on trade capacity building addressing APEP, ABD, and RISE Priorities:\no Via sustained, multi-year projects that are not one-off and that are aimed at changing national-level policies in alignment with priorities in addition to sharing information via workshops.\nThat appropriate international treaties, references and standards be a guiding :unselected: principle of this work.\no That U.S. aid agencies including USAID, USTDA and DFC et al develop their :unselected: project RFPs, related contracting, contracting qualifications, projects and partnerships in line with APEP/ABD/RISE priorities.\no That these U.S. aid agencies establish an interagency mechanism to coordinate :unselected: this work ensuring maximized coherence and impact and minimized duplication or conflicts.\no That this inter-agency process include the relevant USG agencies to ensure :unselected: project policy alignment with the corresponding USG policy leads: e.g. USTR (trade), DOC (commerce), HHS and USFDA (health), OMB/OIRA (GRP), USCBP (TF), et al.\no That this inter-agency process include U.S. Treasury and coordinate its work with that of the many related projects being conducted via the Inter-Ameican Development Bank (IDB).\no That U.S. Treasury and the office of the Executive Director to the IDB establish an inter-agency process to ensure that IDB funded projects - in their review and approval processes - are aligned with the APEP goals and broader USG policies\nPage 3 of 7 :unselected: :selected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nthat lie outside the remit of Teasury, e.g. trade, trade facilitaton, good regulatory practices, modernization of state, health et al.\nCustoms and trade facilitation\n. AdvaMed recommends that APEP focus on securing full implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) - including with related trade capacity building.\n. Even if per soft agreements that may be secured, we recommend that APEP focus on establishing a regional consensus or agreement to keep import licensing times below five (5) days at all times, at least for life-critical health products - and to publish related metrics.\nValue and supply chain resilience and sustainability, with particular focus on clean energy, medical supplies and semiconductors\n. We recommend that whatever work APEP conducts on \"medical supplies\" supply chain resilience and sustainability that, to ensure clarity, proper policy development and action:\no The parties recognize the WHO definition of \"Health Products\" that includes :unselected: medicines and medical devices (including diagnostics), and the IMDRF definition of medical device (including diagnostics).1\no The parties recognize the critical difference and distinction between the :unselected: separate health sub-sectors of medicines and medical devices (including diagnostics).\no That the parties work with RISE that already provides the regional platform bringing together the relevant public and private sector parties on health and the economy.\no :unselected:\nThat USTR and TPSC consider in the context of APEP supply chain work AdvaMed's written contribution on Promoting Supply Chain Resilience - Docket Number USTR-2024-0002.\nInclusive Trade, including for women, Indigenous Peoples, and other underrepresented groups as well as Issues of particular relevance to small and medium-sized enterprises\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, \"Nearly 96% of consumers live outside the United States, and two-thirds of the world's purchasing power is in foreign countries.\" 2\n1 https://www.interamericancoalithttps://www.interamericancoalition-medtech.org/regulatory-convergence/wp- content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/MD-Definition-Website.pdfion-medtech.org/regulatory-convergence/wp- content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/MD-Definition-Website.pdf\n2 https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-locations/headquarters-offices/office-international-trade/international- sales\nPage 4 of 7 :selected: :unselected: :unselected:\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nAccording to the 2019 Annual Business Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau, covering reference year 2018, approximately 18.3% (1.0 million) of all U.S. businesses were minority-owned. 3\nAccording to a 2015 Report of the U.S. Department of Commerce - Minority Business Development Agency, minority business enterprises \"benefitted from exporting when compared to nonminority-owned exporters.\" In particular, \"Exports accounted for 14.4 percent of total receipts ($212.3 billion) of minority-owned exporters compared to 5.4 percent of total receipts ($2.5 trillion) for nonminority-owned exporters.\" 4\nAccording to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative: 5\nSmall businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, creating two-thirds of all new jobs in recent decades. Small businesses which export grow faster, add jobs faster, and pay higher wages, accounting for 98 percent of all identified U.S. exporters and supporting nearly four million jobs in communities across America through both direct and indirect exports. Top export destinations for U.S. small business include Canada, Mexico, China, Japan and the United Kingdom.\nTariffs and non-tariff barriers can disproportionately burden the nearly 300,000 U.S. small- and medium-size (SME) businesses exporting to foreign markets. Across our policy activities, we are working to better integrate SME issues and priorities into U.S. trade policy activities, increase USTR outreach to small businesses, and improve coordination across U.S. trade policy and promotion activities relating to SMEs.\nIssues of particular interest to U.S. SME exporters include work to address e- commerce and digital economy issues, customs and trade facilitation measures, reduction of regulatory barriers, government procurement access, professional services recognition, protection of intellectual property rights abroad, and enhanced information resources and cooperation.\nTaking the information cited above into context:\n· SMEs comprise 98% of U.S. businesses and exporters.\n. Minority-owned businesses comprise nearly a fifth of SMEs.\n. Minority-owned exporters benefit nearly three times as much from exports compared to nonminority-owned exporters.\n3 https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/annual-business-survey.html\n4 https://www.mbda.gov/page/minority-exporters-characteristics-and-strategies-new-business-and-expansion\n5 https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/small-business\nPage 5 of 7\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\n. Nearly 96% of consumers live outside the United States, and two-thirds of the world's purchasing power is in foreign countries.\nInternational trade in general, the APEP, and the recommendations AdvaMed provides for APEP in this submission, all stand to provide benefits in the Americas for inclusive trade, including for women, Indigenous Peoples, and other underrepresented groups as well as the entrepreneurs and workers in the many small and medium-sized enterprises that underpin the economies and health systems of the Americas.\nLabor standards and worker rights / Environment, climate, and conservation\n. AdvaMed recommends that USG leverage the APEP to seek to expand the related provisions of the USMCA to other jurisdictions, enforcing these and other trade agreement commitments - recognizing that only selective enforcement of trade obligations both undermines the rule of law across all disciplines as well as contributes to unmerited skepticism on the benefits of trade to societies.\nTransparency and good regulatory practices\n. AdvaMed recommends that USG leverage the APEP and the 2022 Declaration on Good Regulatory Practices 6, and work with USTR, OMB/OIRA, DOC/ITA, U.S. aid agencies, ANSI the IDB, ABD and RISE to:\no Continue to promote GRP across the hemisphere with trade authorities, central :unselected: regulatory coordination bodies, regulatory authorities of all sectors, national standards bodies, private sector.\no Improve the conditions to expand the trade commitment provisions of USMCA :unselected: Chapter 28 on GRP to other jurisdictions - recognizing the excellent progress with the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Ecuador.\no Prioritize GRP over and prior to sector-specific regulatory convergence efforts, :unselected: recognizing that: (a) lasting and sustainable regulatory alignment is only possible through GRP; (b) the overwhelming majority of regional trade barriers are non- tariff technical barriers to trade that exist as the result of the lack of foundational GRP implementation.\no That, per inter-agency coordination, U.S. Treasury ensure that for any and all regulatory-related projects approved and funded by the IDB, that the recipient governments have implemented sufficient GRP frameworks and techncal assistance to make any subsequent regulatory investment meaningful and aligned with USG policy and APEP prioriites.\n6 https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/june/ustr-announces-new-declaration- good-regulatory-\npractices# :~: text=USTR%20Announces%20New%20Declaration%20on%20Good%20Regulatory%20Practices,- June%2009%2C%202022\u0026text=Good%20regulatory%20practices%20are%20fundamental,compliance%20with%20 international%20trade%20obligations.\nPage 6 of 7 :selected: :unselected:\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nAnti-corruption\n. AdvaMed recommends that that APEP focus on promoting and/or extending the provisions of USMCA Chapter 27 on Anticorruption with partners across the region as already accomplished in the U.S .- Brazil ATEC Protocol and U.S .- Ecuador TIC Protocol.\n. In particular, we recommend that APEP focus on promoting and advancing regionally the provisions of USMCA Chapter 27 Article 27.5 on Participation of Private Sector and Society in support of Anticorruption commitments.\nTrade capacity building needs and priorities\n. As highlighted under our general comments above, we recommend that a primary focus of APEP work be coordinated and sustained trade capacity building and technical assistance across all APEP priorities, aid agencies and the IDB and in alignment with USG policies as well as international treaties, references and standards.\nOther matters related to trade and investment in the Americas that are consistent with the mission and scope of the Partnership\nProcurement Reform (with impacts on Transparency and Anti-corruption)\n• Consistent with the IX Summit of the Americas Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic Governance as adopted by the Heads of State and Government on June 9, 2022 in Los Angeles 7 Section C - Transparency and Anticorruption Articles 12 and 20, AdvaMed recommends that APEP partner with RISE to advance Procurement Reform in the Americas with technical assistance projects and workstreams focused on implementing international benchmarks of Value-Based Procurement and Ethics \u0026 Compliance Enablers in their application to health products including medical devices, working with and leveraging the Inter-American Network on Government Procurement (INGP) and following the lead of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Global Procurement Initiative (GPI) and working in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Commerce Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) partnering with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as appropriate.\nSincerely,\nSteven Bipes Vice President - Global Strategy \u0026 Analysis Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) 1301 Pennsylvania Avenue NW - 4th Floor - Washington, DC 20004 sbipes@advamed.org\n7 https://summit-americas.org/documentos_oficiales_ixsummit/CMBRS02295e02.pdf\nPage 7 of 7 :unselected: :unselected:",

We applaud the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) for its efforts  to develop a more \ncomprehensive Diversity Action Plan guidance, replacing the 2022 \nguidance  to ensure data inclu ded in regulatory submissions for \nmedical products reflect  not only  the racial and ethnic diversity of \ntheir intended use populations , but also take into consideration \nsex, age, and geographic location . This guidance should enhance \nsponsors’ identification of safety and efficacy outcomes that may \nbe associated with, or occurring more frequently within, \nunderrepresented populations. ASCO agrees that ensuring \nscientific discoveries benefit all patients is  critical to keeping the \nUnited States at the forefront  of biomedical research. Additionally, \nwe support the agency’s recognition of the importance of global \nmedical product development  and supporting the use of well -\ndesigned multi -regional clinical studies, when appropriate , to \nprovide evidence of safety and effectiveness  with consideration \ngiven to differences in disease characteristics . However, we \nencourage collaboration across all stakeholders to ensure effective  \n2 \n \napproaches can be employed and we consider  challenges such as the lack of uniformity \nin population descriptors, as appropriately noted in th is and other FDA  draft guidance.  \n \nASCO  is a national organization representing more than 50,000 oncology professionals \nwho care for patients with cancer. Through research, education, and promotion of the \nhighest -quality, equitable patient care, our members are committed to ensuring access \nto evidence -based care for the prevention, diagnosis, and  treatment for all \nAmericans.  ASCO supports robust quality initiatives that enhance performance \nmeasurement and improvement, clinical practice guidelines, big data analytics, and the \nvalue of cancer care.   \n \nAs cancer care becomes increasingly  complex and personalized, it is more important \nthan ever to ensure participation by individuals reflective of the epidemiology of the \ndisease. All populations should have equitable opportunities to participate in, be \nrecognized for, and benefit from resear ch of all types , including clinical trials. \nUnfortunately, a wide range of barriers prevent many patients from the processes that \nlead to these outcomes, including participation at the onset . Because of this, certain \npopulations continue to be underreprese nted in clinical trials and health care -related \nresearch  and subsequent benefits . \n \nOverall, ASCO is supportive of t his new  FDA draft guidance. Specifically, we support \nthe emphasis on sponsors engaging the FDA  early  to discuss  their Diversity Action \nPlans, and with the new specificity of no later than the date on which the sponsor \nsubmits the protocol to FDA for the phase 3 study  (or other pivotal study)  or \nInvestigational Device  Exemption (IDE) application.  We appreciate that the draft \nguidance  requires the Diversity Action Plans ’ study enrollment be disaggregated by the \nrace, ethnicity, sex, and age group demographic characteristics of the clinically relevant \npopulation. We agree that s ponsors should consider whether certain demographic \ngroups (e.g., older patients, pediatric patients, females, a particular race or ethnic group \nor combinations thereof) may have a different response to the medical product —either \ndifferential effectiveness  or safety (e.g., based upon differential pharmacokinetics (PK), \npharmacodynamics (PD), or due to possible differences in susceptibility to specific \nadverse events of concern for a drug or medical device), or due to differential \npresentation of the disease or condition. We would like to emphasize that it may be \nnecessary  to increase the proportional enrollment of a certain population in the clinical \nstudy to evaluate outcomes of interest or other clinically relevant factors in that group . In \nour work to broaden eligibility criteria (EC) with the FDA, Friends of Can cer Research \n(Friends ), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), we have emphasized that:  \n \n“…inclusion of all populations who are anticipated to benefit from the therapy \nbased on the mechanism of action early in clinical development is both equitable \nand necessary. This will ensure that patients who may ultimately benefit from the  \n3 \n \ntreatment being studied are not excluded because of lack of safety data for that \npopulation. If representative populations are not included, dose, tolerance, risk of \nadverse events, and therapeutic benefit remain unknown. The inclusion of \nexploratory cohor ts with broader eligibility in early -phase trials will help to inform \nand enable revisions to the protocol’s EC based on these earlier risk -benefit \nanalyses. These exploratory cohorts should help sponsors strike a balance \nbetween more rapid patient accrual  with broader criteria, time associated with \nenacting protocol amendments later in development, and number of post -\nmarketing requirements and commitments to expedite trial completion and \nsubmission of more complete study findings to regulatory agencies, ul timately \nleading to broader knowledge in clinical use.”1  \n \nThe design, eligibility criteria, endpoints, and geographic locations of the trial sites all \nhave a significant impact on whether diversity and inclusion strategies are successful, \nso it is important that these dimensions of trial design are included in  the Diversity \nAction Plans . Section V.C. of the guidance identifies measures and  strategies  for \nsponsors to meet enrollment goals , including language assistance, transportation, \ncommunity engagement, community advisory boards, cultural competency, navigators , \ncommunity health workers, patient advocacy groups, local healthcare providers, and  \ntactics for  reducing burdens due to trial/study design/conduct. ASCO is please d to see \nour comments from 2022 are reflected with the inclusion of limiting clinical study \nexclusion criteria and characteristics for more patient -centric (decentralized) trials.  We \nknow that eligibility criteria (in particular, those related to comorbidities, and organ \nfunction) and barriers to trial accessibility often unnecessarily exclude clinical trial \nparticipation by patients from historically underrepresented populations. Eligibility \ncriteria should be as broad as possible to ensure that participants included on pivotal \ntrials are representative of the popula tion who will use the product after approval. We \nalso support increasing patient access to clinical trials through models such as \ndecentralization of trials, including electronic consent, which enables required \nsignatures an d remote recruiting , remote collection of labs and radiology, the use of \nremote visits/ telehealth,  and more efficient and streamlined use of FDA Form 15722,3. \nDecentralized trials have the potential to reduce patient and sponsor burden and \nincrease accrual and retention of a more diverse trial population , including rural and \nunderserved populations.   \n \n1 Kim ES, Uldrick TS, Schenkel C, et al.

JCO 0, JCO.24.00961  \nDOI:10.1200/JCO.24.00961   \n4 \n \n \nASCO has several initiatives we would like to highlight for the Agency that align with the \ngoals of this draft guidance, and with the hope that the entire cancer community can \ncontinue to collaborate to realize these shared goals.  ASCO’s  Targeted Agent and \nProfiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) Study,4 was designed in alignment with the \nASCO -Friends  broadened eligibility criteria to enable more diverse participation in the \nstudy, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, \nprior malignancies, multiple co -morbidities, positive HIV status, and/or previously \ntreated but cl inically stable brain metastases. We have also engaged investigators and \nresearch sites with demonstrated commitment and success enrolling more diverse \npopulations on clinical trials. Since we launched the study in March 2016, we have \nconsented more  than 3,500 participants and enrolled more than 2,400 on study \ntherapies. Our involvement of diverse populations is better than most trials submitted to \nthe FDA, including 11.5% of participants who are Black, approximately 43% of \nparticipants aged 65 years and older, 6.5% of participants who are Hispanic/LatinX , and \n4.2% of participants who are Asian. In addition, the study includes the opportunity to \nstudy the intervention in a pediatric population. We believe the strategies highlighted by \nthe FDA in the draft guidance will help diversify study participants as we continue to \nlook for ways to improve our equity, diversity, and inclusion.  \n \nASCO’s goals for  ensuring  all patients have access to the highest quality  cancer care  \narise from the Society’s ongoing efforts to address cancer disparities . In August 2020, \nASCO issued a formal policy statement5 on cancer disparities and health equity calling \nfor bolder, more aggressive steps to achieve equity for all patients. This statement, \ntogether with ASCO’s Road to Recovery Report6, serves as ASCO’s blueprint for \nprioritizing action that can address issues of health equity in cancer care . The statement \nincluded a focus on ensuring equitable patient access to research, utilizing strategies \nFDA has included in this draft guidance. Strategies recommended in our statement \nincluded: the use of stratified recruitment to ensure enrollment of subpo pulations at risk \nof disparate toxicity or mortality, as well as the collection and reporting of trial data on \ndemographic factors known to influence cancer outcomes. ASCO also recommended \ncontinued investment in infrastructure and collaborations that ca n help overcome multi -\nlevel barriers to equitable research participation.   \n \n4 Mangat PK, Halabi S, Bruinooge SS, et al.

This plan sets forth tangible steps ASCO can take to create substantial and \nsustainable change. This plan is guided by three key strategies :  \n• Develop c linical trials that more accurately represent the population of patients \nwith cancer  who will ultimately benefit from the medical product  by ensur ing all \npatients have equitable access to clinical trials and that they  are routinely offered \nas a treatment optio n.  \n• Build and sustain  a diverse oncology workforce that reflects the demographics of \nthe population it serves and is trained to both recognize and mitigate disparities.   \n• Reduce access barriers to patient care and participation in clinical trials by \nequipping practices with the resources needed to deliver high -quality, equitable \ncare.   \n \nMost recently, ASCO and the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) \nreleased a joint research statement8 that aligns well with the Agency’s draft guidance \nwith specific recommendations and strategies for the research community to improve \nequity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in cancer clinical trials. There are six \nrecommendations with proposed strategies and roles for various stakeholders: (1) \nclinical tri als are an integral component of high -quality cancer care, and every person \nwith cancer should have the opportunity to participate; (2) trial sponsors and \ninvestigators should design and implement trials with a focus on reducing barriers and \nenhancing EDI,  and work with sites to conduct trials in ways that increase participation \nof under -represented populations; (3) trial sponsors, researchers, and sites should form \nlong-standing partnerships with patients, patient advocacy groups, and community \nleaders and  groups; (4) anyone designing or conducting trials should complete recurring \neducation, training, and evaluation to demonstrate and maintain cross -cultural \ncompetencies, mitigation of bias, effective communication, and a commitment to \nachieving EDI; (5) re search stakeholders should invest in programs and policies that \nincrease EDI in trials and in the research workforce; and (6) research stakeholders \nshould collect and publish aggregate data on racial and ethnic diversity of trial \nparticipants when reportin g results of trials, programs, and interventions to increase \nEDI. These recommendations were developed as part of a broader ASCO collaboration \nwith ACCC to identify and implement novel strategies and practical solutions to increase \nclinical trial participa tion of patients from racial and ethnic minority populations that \n \n7  American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Action \nPlan 2021.  https://www.asco.org/sites/new -www.asco.org/files/content -files/advocacy/documents/2021 -\nASCO -EDI-Action -Plan.pdf  \n8 Oyer RA, Hurley P, Boehmer L, et al.

Earlier this year, ASCO  also \nissued a policy statement underscoring the urgent need for global equity in clinical trials. \nThe statement highlights that without full representation in clinical research by patients \nand clinicians in diverse communities, progress will be slowed —and the burden of \ncancer will continue to fall disproportionately on those least able to overcome it.9 \n \nASCO and the cancer care community as a whole have made important progress in the \npast 10 years in addressing health care disparities, including education, quality of care, \nworkforce diversity, and research. However, persistent cancer disparities motivate \nASCO to renew a long -standing commitment to reduce cancer health inequities for all \npopulations, expanding our focus to include factors such as economic inequality, \nadvanced age, sexual and gender minority status, and geographic differences , as \noutlined in  this updated draft guidance to sponsors in the development of their Diversity \nAction Plans . We recognize that there is still much work to be done to reduce inequities \nin cancer care. We appreciate the concrete steps this guidance takes in proposing \ndevelopment of operational measures that will be implemented to enroll and retain \nunderrepresente d participants. We recognize the  efforts the development of the \nDiversity Action Plans will require of sponsors . We appreciate the flexibility the draft \nguidance allows for  sponsors to submit explanations and rationales for  appropriate \nwaivers on a case -by-case  basis . However, it is our hope that the cancer community \nincluding the private sector will continue to focus on these important high impact efforts . \nASCO looks  forward to working with the FDA and others in the community to make \nmeaningful progress.  \n \nThank you again for the opportunity to contribute to the FDA’s proposal to improve \nenrollment of participants from underrepresented populations in clinical trials. We are \neager to continue our work with you on this important effort.

As part of this policy,' CMS invites \nrecommendations for additional drugs, biologicals, and medical devices that meet the criteria established \nfor separate payment. \nIn the Proposed Rule, CMS provisionally determined that one medical device, the ON-Q* Pump,' an \nelastomeric infusion pump, meets the medical device criteria for separate payment.' Baxter Healthcare \nmarkets an elastomeric infusion pump — the SimplFusor — that is functionally equivalent to the ON-Q* \nPump.' Given that the ON-Q* Pump and the SimplFusor are interchangeable devices (as described in more \ndetail in this letter), we believe that the peer-reviewed study submitted in support of the ON-Q* Pump also \nserves to demonstrate the ability of the SimplFusor to \"replace, reduce, or avoid intraoperative or \npostoperative opioid use or the quantity of opioids prescribed,\" as required to qualify for separate payment. \nAccordingly, we believe that the SimplFusor meets the required criteria, and we recommend that CMS \napprove the SimplFusor for separate payment under the non-opioid treatments for pain relief policy in the \nfinal CY25 OPPS/ASC payment rule. \nAs the SimplFusor elastomeric pump is functionally equivalent to and interchangeable with the ON-Q* \nelastomeric pump, the device that CMS proposes to approve in the Proposed Rule, CMS should also \n189 FR 59186. \n2 Public Law 117-328, 117th Congress, December 29, 2022. \nThe \"Non-Opioid Policy for Pain Relief Under the OPPS and ASC Payment System\" is detailed at 89 FR 59186, 59427-433. \nHCPCS code C98X4. \nAs noted in the Proposed Rule, the ON-Q* Pump's submission for separate payment consideration was supported by a 2015 peer-reviewed article: \nDing DY, Manoli A 3rd, Galos DK, Jain S, Tejwani NC.

PMID: \n26165259. \nSimplfusor 1\" is a Baxter International Inc. registered trademark marketed in the United States through' a supply agreement with Epic International \n(Thailand) Co. Ltd. \napprove the SimplFusor as part of the finalization of the CY25 proposed rule. We respectfully request a \nmeeting to discuss our request further and to address any questions. \nCMS Should Approve the SimplFusorTM Elastomeric Pump for Separate Payment \nAs stated in the Proposed Rule,' medical devices must meet five criteria to qualify for separate payment as \nnon-opioid treatments for pain relief under the OPPS and the ASC Payment System. A medical device must: \n(1)be used to deliver a therapy to reduce post-operative pain or produce post-surgical or regional analgesia; \n(2)have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, market clearance, or an appropriate exemption \nfrom the requirements of section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; (3) have \ndemonstrated the ability to replace, reduce, or avoid intra-operative or post-operative opioid use or the \nquantity of opioids prescribed in a clinical trial or through data published in a peer-reviewed journal; (4) not \nreceive transitional pass-through payment; and (5) have payment that is packaged into a payment for a \ncovered OPD service/group of services. \nAs outlined in more detail below, the SimplFusor meets these criteria and should be approved for separate \npayment as a non-opioid treatment for pain relief. This interpretation is consistent with the statutory \ncriteria and adheres to its intent to provide greater patient access. \n1.The SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump meets the first criterion because the SimplFusor is a \nmedical device used to deliver therapies to reduce postoperative pain and produce post-surgical \nand regional analgesia. As evidenced by its FDA clearance (attached for reference), the SimplFusor \nis indicated for the continuous infusion of medications directly into an intra-operative site or \nsubcutaneously for postoperative pain management.' The SimplFusor reduces post-operative pain \nby delivering local anesthetic that reduces the patient's ability to feel pain. \n2.The SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump meets the second criterion because it has 510(k) \nclearance from the FDA. The SimplFusor has received the appropriate FDA medical device \nclearances to be marketed for its intended uses (see attached clearance letter and footnote). The \nSimplFusor is a Baxter-trademarked version of the SMARTeZ Pump, which received FDA clearance \nfor \"continuous infusion of medications for general infusion use, including pain management\" \n(K151650). \n3.The SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump meets the third criterion because it has \ndemonstrated the ability to reduce postoperative opioid use in data published in a peer-reviewed \njournal by its equivalence to a tested device. In support of its application for separate payment, the \nON-Q* Pump submitted a peer-reviewed study demonstrating that continuously infused regional \nanesthetic for pain control in ankle fracture surgery patients significantly reduces post-operative \npain and reduces the need for oral opioids (compared with the use of single-shot nerve block). In \nthe study, 50 patients were randomly assigned to receive the single-shot nerve block or the \ncontinuous infusion through the infusion pump. The study found that the infusion pump patient \ngroup had lower average pain scores and took fewer opioid pain pills post-operatively.' \nWe believe this study demonstrates that the use of elastomeric infusion pumps to deliver pain \nmanagement therapies reduces post-operative pain and, accordingly, reduces the need for patients \nThese criteria appear in the Social Security Act section 1833(t)(16)(G)(iv). \nSee K151650 (2016). More information about the SimplFusor is available at \nhttps://ecatalog.baxter.com/ecatalog/loadResource.blob?bid=20021082.  \n'See Ding, et al. Continuous Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Block Versus Single Injection Nerve Block for Ankle Fracture Surgery: A Prospective Randomized \nComparative Trial. 1 Orthop Trauma. 2015 Sep; 29(9):393-8. doi: 10.1097/BOT.0000000000000374. PMID: 26165259. \n2 \nto use opioid pain medications. Elastomeric infusion pumps, including the SimplFusor, are \ndeveloped, FDA-cleared, and used for precisely this purpose — the continuous infusion of drugs that \nreduce the patient's ability to feel pain and, as a result, reduce the patient's need for and use of \nadditional pain medications (including opioids). \nAs the SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump and the ON-Q* Pump are functionally equivalent and  \ninterchangeable devices, we believe that the referenced study also demonstrates the SimplFusor's \nability to reduce post-operative pain and to reduce the use of opioids for post-operative pain \nmanagement. Both pumps deliver variable and customizable flow rates to fit the infusion and pain \nmanagement needs of the patient; both pumps are used for postoperative pain management by \ndelivering local anesthetic that reduces the patient's ability to feel pain and reduces the need for \nopioid use. Both pumps provide postoperative pain relief for several days. \nThe SMARTeZ Pump's 510(k) clearance letter (K151650, attached; see Table 5-2) also demonstrates \nthat the FDA considers Baxter's elastomeric infusion pump and the ON-Q* Pump (and the SMARTeZ \nPump) to be substantially equivalent devices. The ON-Q* Pump's most recent clearance (K181360) \nis predicated upon clearance K063530, which in turn is predicated upon K052117, which appears in \nthe SMARTeZ Pump's clearance letter in Table 5-2 as the I-Flow Corporation's \"I-Flow Elastomeric \nPump.\" Accordingly, in clearing the SMARTeZ Pump, the FDA also determined that the ON-Q* Pump \nand the SimplFusor are substantially equivalent devices. \nConducting separate studies for every functionally equivalent pain management device would be \nduplicative and economically infeasible (particularly for relatively low-cost devices). Given that \nsuccessfully combatting the opioid crisis will require the availability of as many alternatives as \npossible, we strongly urge CMS to interpret available device studies as satisfying the requirement to \ndemonstrate opioid use reduction for additional functionally equivalent and interchangeable \ndevices. \nWe believe such an application would align with the CAA's intent of disincentivizing the use of \nopioids for pain management (and, thus, reducing the probability of opioid addiction) by making \nnon-opioid pain management devices more easily accessible. If a studied device and another device \nare interchangeable, we believe both devices have demonstrated the ability to reduce opioid use by \ntheir equivalence. Accordingly, the study submitted supporting the ON-Q* Pump's application  \nindicates that the SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump also meets the third criterion. \n4.The SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump meets the fourth criterion because the SimplFusor \ndoes not receive transitional pass-through payment. Like the On-Q* Pump, the SimplFusor \nelastomeric pump is available and used in the outpatient hospital setting. Its cost is bundled into \nthe Ambulatory Payment Classification associated with its use. It is not paid separately and is not \neligible for pass-through payment.' \n5.The SimplFusor elastomeric infusion pump meets the fifth and final criterion because the \nSimplFusor is packaged into a payment for a covered OPD service. Like the On-Q Pump, the \nSimplFusor elastomeric pump is available and used in the outpatient hospital setting. Its cost is \nbundled into the Ambulatory Payment Classification associated with its use.' \n\" 42 CFR § 419.66. \n1142 CFR § 419.31. \n3 \nConclusion \nBaxter Healthcare appreciates the Agency's review of our recommendation to approve the SimplFusor \nelastomeric pump for separate payment in the outpatient department and ambulatory surgical center \nsettings. As the SimplFusor elastomeric pump is functionally equivalent to and interchangeable with the \nOn-Q* elastomeric pump, the device that CMS proposes to approve in the Proposed Rule, we believe that \nCMS should also approve the SimplFusor. We respectfully request a meeting to discuss our request further \nand to address any questions. Mark Coin (Mark Coin@baxter.com ) will reach out to the appropriate staff to \narrange a meeting to address any questions or additional information needed to evaluate our request. To \ncontinue to combat the deadly and devasting opioid epidemic, we strongly encourage CMS to approve as \nmany non-opioid treatments for separate payment as possible. \nSincerely, \nJoseph Schwan  Joseph Scf-fluan (Sep 4, 2024 07:54 EDT) \nJV Schwan \nGlobal Head, Government Affairs \nAttachments \n•SMARTeZ Pump's FDA Clearance letter demonstrating substantial equivalence of the SimplFusor and \nthe ON-Q* Pump: K151650 \n•Additional ON-Q* Pump's FDA Clearances referenced: K181360, K063530, and K052117. \n•SimplFusor's support (as an equivalent and interchangeable device) for criterion three: \nDing DY, Manoli A 3rd, Galos DK, Jain S, Tejwani NC.

SMARTeZ Pump Traditional 510(k) Submission \n5.5 Indications for Use Statements \nThe SMARTeZ Pump (Long infusion time article) is intended for continuous infusion of \nmedications for general infusion use, including pain management. \n•Routes of administration: intravenous and subcutaneous. \nThe SMARTeZ Pump (Short infusion time article) is intended for continuous infusion of \nmedications for general infusion use, including antibiotic delivery. \n•Route of adrninistration: intravenous. \nThe SMARTeZ Pump (Chemotherapy article) is intended for continuous infusion of \nchemotherapy medications. \n•Routes of administration: intravenous and intra-arterial. \nThe Indications for Use statement of the SMARTeZ Pump is not identical to the predicate \ndevices; however, the differences in infusion routes do not alter the intended use of the \ndevice nor do they affect the safety and effectiveness of the device relative to the predicates. \nAll devices have the same intended use for the continuous infusion of medications. \n5.6 Technological Characteristics \nThe SMARTeZ Pump is a non-electrically driven, portable fixed flow rate infusion pump. \nThe flow rate of the device is pre-determined by the manufacturer using Hagen-Poiseuille \ntheory, which calculates the volumetric flow rate of a fluid with certain viscosity passing \nthrough a cylindrical pipe. \nThe device consists of three (3) critical cornponents that control the factors that determine the \nflow rate: The fluid reservoir, the micro bore tube and the flow restrictor. The fluid reservoir \nholds the medication to be infused and exert pressure onto the medication as the energy \nsource of the device. The micro bore tube and the flow restrictor on each device are \ncalibrated to rnatch with the fluid reservoir so the rnedication will pass through thern under a \nfixed pre-determined flow rate. \nSection §5: 510(k) Summary \n(K151650) Section §5 - pg. 3 \nEgg \nEpic Medical Pte.

Pain scores were significantly lower in the \nOn Q group at the 12 hours postoperative time point (P = 0.002) and at 2 weeks postoperatively. The \nnumber of pain pills taken in the first 72 hours was lower in the On Q group (14.9 vs. 20.0; P = 0.036). \nOverall, 7/23 patients in the On Q group had their pump malfunction and 1 patient accidently \nremoved the catheter. \nConclusions: Use of continuously infused regional anesthetic for pain control in ankle fracture \nsurgery significantly reduces \"rebound pain\" and the need for oral opioid analgesia compared with \nsingle-shot regional anesthetic. \nLevel of evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

Organized in 2021, PFPS US is the U.S. chapter of Patients for Patient Safety, a patient-led network of safety and equity advocates affiliated with the World Health Organization. Our focus is advancing transparency, accountability and patient \u0026 family engagement in pursuit of the goal of zero preventable harm for all users of healthcare in the U.S. The PFPS US network includes over 150 patient safety “champions” who have been oriented to our work, as well as more than 30 organizational partners who work collaboratively with us to advocate for safer, more transparent care in the U.S.   In 2022-23, PFPS US had a year-long AI Working Group to evaluate patient expectations and concerns for AI.  It identified four priorities for AI: 1) data integrity and bias, 2) efficacy of algorithms, 3) payment, 4) transparency and shared improvement. Building on that work, the following comments were developed by the PFPS US Public Comment Group, a multi-stakeholder group focused on improving patient safety and dedicated to contributing the lived experiences of patients and families to public policy development and continuous learning.  As a patient-centered organization focused on preventing harm in healthcare, we are optimistic about the transformative potential of AI to remedy or mitigate current risks of harm that patients regularly experience, deliver safer care for all, including subpopulations now at exacerbated risk, and improve outcomes across the board for all patient populations.  Simultaneously, we are concerned that without careful oversight of AI development, deployment and use that recognizes and includes patients as AI users and overseers, there is significant risk that AI will be excessively driven by vendor-centric interests. Accordingly, we recognize the crucial role that regulation plays in shaping the future of AI-enabled care.  PFPS US holds that generative AI-enabled devices with a medical purpose clearly must fall under the medical device regulations of FDA. FDA’s role in regulating medical devices is crucial to ensuring their safety and effectiveness. PFPS US advocates for regulator deliberation and action that considers and attends to these specific concerns:  Patients For Patient Safety US  \nPatients For Patient Safety US | 251 Still Pine Bend, Smyrna, Georgia 30082 | 678.309.9605 \n Establishing threshold standards for Data Access, Security and Use: PFPS US believes that clear standards for accessing and sharing patient data must be established, starting with a foundational recognition of a patient’s right to consent to how their data is used and shared. There should also be a way for patients and provider users of AI to report digital harm events whether they be a security breach of data sharing that puts a patient at risk to an algorithm that led to a wrong or missed diagnosis or inaccuracies from ambient scribes that put inaccurate information into the medical record.  AI-enabled medical devices should not be considered for use by healthcare providers on or in patient care or be considered for payment by federal agencies unless they meet these standards of patient protection, use, and have a pathway for patients and providers to report concerns.  Similarly, Ambient Clinical Documentation technologies or any AI product that touch any phase of the patient medical record need to meet such standards.   Independent Governance: In the US, patients look to the FDA for oversight for technologies, drugs and medical devices, not from industry-driven and industry-led membership organizations that are currently establishing governance frameworks and guidelines. We think independent oversight from industry is crucial, otherwise standards established by industry membership-driven bodies will ultimately bend toward the interests of its vendor members. Metrics matter in determining the success of AI and if the success metrics are only centered on vendor and health system priorities (e.g. workload reduction for ambient scribes or cost reduction for pharma management) then the broader outcomes that might matter to patients, e.g. patient safety, privacy or outcomes, will get sidelined for the sole purpose of profit and the cost reductions will not be shared with patients in lower cost of care. Independent governance should establish balanced scorecards of success and require transparency of weightings, inputs and patient protections.  Patient engagement: As a patient-led network, PFPS US strongly believes in the importance of including representation from patients and family members in healthcare decision making and oversight, particularly when the topic is something as significant as AI design and implementation. Since it is our personal patient data -- often harvested during our most our most vulnerable life experiences and interactions with healthcare organizations -- that is being used to fuel AI development, we, as patients, should have the right to engage in oversight on how our data is being accessed, used, and sold by hospitals, health systems and vendors. We encourage FDA to engage all patients and patient advocacy groups to ensure prioritization in standard setting of what matters to patients, including improved diagnostics, care choices, coordination across the continuum of our care, and the affordability of care.  Usefulness, usability and efficacy: Patients recognize that the lens that vendors and health system users would apply for ‘useful, usable and effective’ AI may not align with that of patient perspectives. There should be clear safeguards to protect against AI-based recommendations solely based on profit motives without improvement of outcomes. In addition, just because AI is available doesn’t mean it is additive to the patient outcomes or merits another layer adding on to the already expensive cost of healthcare to patients. PFPS US believes that AI use should be positioned in the sweet spot that complements human decision-making and puts patient safety  Patients For Patient Safety US  \nPatients For Patient Safety US | 251 Still Pine Bend, Smyrna, Georgia 30082 | 678.309.9605 \nand optimal care outcomes, not profit, as the first priority of the algorithmic efficacy criteria.  AI tools should support and improve the provider’s decision-making, not replace it. Further, the patient has the right to know when recommendations or choices about their care are driven solely by AI vs. AI with consultation of their care team.   Fairness, equity, and bias management: It is imperative that AI tools in the assessment process use data from the populations it intends to serve to inform the recommendations for that population. Similarly, AI tools should use data from the individual, e.g., medical history, to inform recommendations for that individual. Oversight should require that AI models be trained, evaluated and monitored on evidence-based best practices and outcomes for the specific communities of care with which they are used as a metric for success.   Safety and reliability: Developers of AI need to be accountable for the safety of AI guidance and have clear mechanisms that address improvement, feedback, communication of issues/concerns, and accountability. Patients and users need an independent platform to raise and report safety concerns about AI that have the potential to trigger investigation. Efficacy of models need an alert system to go out to all users until problems are resolved to protect patient care in the same way products have a recall or pause distribution until a problem is resolved.  PFPS US favors the establishment of a duty of disclosure of harm where AI is a cause or contributor to the patients and/or families impacted as well as to their healthcare providers.   Transparency, intelligibility and accountability: It is imperative that patients are specified clearly as key stakeholders in discussions about AI transparency. What transparency means to a patient can differ from a vendor-driven definition of transparency. From transparency about the data used to train AI tools to transparency and disclosure to patients after an AI-related error has occurred, transparency across the full spectrum should be an enforceable duty.   Security and Privacy: Patients have very significant concerns about how their data is being used and shared and the inability to ‘opt out’. Standards should be established, and vendors and health systems should be subject to stringent oversight if and when they sell patient data for commercial purposes outside of direct care delivery.  There should be meaningful, enforceable consequences when abuse is found.  PFPS US is also very concerned that if patients are not given the chance to ‘opt out’ of AI use in their care, it can lead to harm. For example, a patient may have unique genetics or a rare condition that can be mistaken for a more common disease. AI use in this context may expose patients to unnecessary or wrong treatment for the wrong condition if it misreads elements of an ambient conversation or the medical record. PFPS US also supports clear, high standards for the management of cybersecurity risks to patient data and the ability for the re-integration of deidentified patient data.  Pilot Deploy and Monitor: PFPS US is deeply concerned with the spectrum of AI that is not clinically tested prior to deployment and after deployment. A solution may perform as planned in a ‘lab-like’ environment but the complex dynamics of the healthcare environment continually introduce new, unanticipated risks in patient care. Piloting in real environments, with inclusion  Patients For Patient Safety US  \nPatients For Patient Safety US | 251 Still Pine Bend, Smyrna, Georgia 30082 | 678.309.9605 \nof patients, should be a key element of testing before deployment. The design, functionality, usability, and effects of any system component – including intelligent technologies – cannot be assured by initial lab tests or even a pilot study in the context of use.    Moreover, ongoing monitoring and management of AI will be of critical importance to achieving the intended benefits of these technologies, while limiting their potential for promulgating conditions for harm. The reality of clinical work systems is that they are in continuous flux. Healthcare organizations need continuous, proactive surveillance strategies that integrate machine learning and routine patient and provider feedback to detect the emergence of problems and anomalies for analysis and management.   Concluding thoughts:  PFPS US supports the Light Collective’s Collective AI Rights For Patients (June 2024)  framing of crucial questions for thoughtful consideration as the AI community of stakeholders shapes the future for patients:  How might health AI ensure equal benefit for all, while upholding patient rights in the process?  How might we build AI systems that align with patient rights and interests?  How do we create independent oversight and validation of health AI solutions which impact patient care?  How can we build transparency and informed consent into uses of AI in healthcare designed for patients and by patients?  How might we build governance systems that center the perspectives, interests, and needs of the people and communities who are most impacted by AI?  We hope that these suggestions for independent governance and oversight provoke discussion and will be prioritized in further consideration by the FDA of the total product lifecycle for generative AI-enabled medical devices.

Box 8010 \nBaltimore, Maryland 21244-8010 \n \nRE: ENT Procedures in the Hospital OPPS and ASC Settings \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs; CY 2025 Payment Policies under the Hospital \nOutpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems  \n \nDear Administrator Brooks-LaSure, \n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the recent proposed rule for Medicare’s hospital \noutpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system \nfor calendar year 2025.  Our comments focus on ensuring patient access to innovative, clinically \neffective otorhinolaryngology (ENT) procedures.   \n \nAerin Medical is a U.S.-based company committed to developing transformative, non-invasive treatment \noptions that address unmet clinical needs and improve the lives of individuals with chronic nasal airway \nconditions.  Aerin Medical developed and manufacturers the VivAer Stylus, RhinAer Stylus, and the \nAerin Medical Console Set, which are used to perform several innovative ENT procedures.   \n \nWe have the following comments on the recent proposed rule: \n \n CMS should protect Medicare beneficiary access to a transformative new procedure for nasal \nobstruction by continuing to assign CPT code 30469 to the list of device-intensive procedures for \nCY 2025 and by reinstating the device offset amount for CPT code 30469 to reflect the full cost \nof the single use device that is integral to performing this surgical procedure.  CMS has a \nsubstantial interest in ensuring that transient learning curves in hospital billing practices do not \nundermine beneficiary access in the ASC setting and that CPT codes like 30469 do not seesaw \nwith respect to device-intensive status from year-to-year. \n \n       \n \nCMS-1809-P, September 9, 2024 \nPage 2 \n \n  CMS should finalize its proposal to assign CPT code 31242 to the list of device-intensive \nprocedures for CY 2025, and CMS should refine its proposal to reflect the full cost of the single \nuse device that is integral and necessary to perform this surgical procedure. \n \nOur comments are discussed in detail below. \n \nI. CMS should protect Medicare beneficiary access to a transformative new procedure for nasal \nobstruction by continuing to assign CPT code 30469 to the list of device-intensive procedures \nfor CY 2025 and by reinstating the device offset amount for CPT code 30469 to reflect the full \ncost of the single use device that is integral to performing this surgical procedure.  CMS has a \nsubstantial interest in ensuring that transient learning curves in hospital billing practices do \nnot undermine beneficiary access in the ASC setting and that CPT codes like 30469 do not \nseesaw with respect to device-intensive status from year-to-year. \n \nTo help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have meaningful access to the transformative new procedure \nfor treating nasal obstruction described by CPT code 30469,1 we urge CMS to ensure fair and reasonable \npayment in the ambulatory surgical center (ASC) setting by reevaluating the device-intensive status of \nCPT code 30469 for CY 2025. \n \nThe AMA CPT Panel established CPT code 30469 effective January 1, 2023 based on the VivAer \ntechnology for ENT physicians to perform a surgical procedure that deploys temperature-controlled \nradiofrequency energy to provide long-term relief from nasal obstruction by remodeling the nasal tissue \nand improving airflow.  The VivAer Stylus device is an essential component for administering this \ntherapy, but lack of device-intensive status as proposed for 2025 would undermine Medicare beneficiary \naccess to this transformative therapy, especially in the ASC setting.   \n \nThe procedure described by CPT code 30469 can only be performed with the VivAer Stylus device, \nwhich is a thin, flexible, high-tech wand for delivering bipolar, temperature-controlled radiofrequency \nenergy to the submucosal tissue in the nasal passages.  The single-use stylus monitors the tissue \ntemperature during treatment and automatically adjusts the power output to maintain the target \ntemperature, optimize therapeutic benefit, and spare the delicate surrounding nasal mucosa. \n \nFor CY 2025, CMS proposed to assign CPT code 30469 to APC 5165 (Level 5 ENT Procedures).  We \nagree that this APC assignment will promote both clinical and resource homogeneity because the \nclinical characteristics and resource costs of CPT code 30469 are very similar to the other device-\nintensive ENT procedures that are assigned to APC 5165. \n \nIn 2024, CMS assigned CPT code 30469 to the list of device-intensive procedures.  However, in the \nnotice of proposed rulemaking for CY 2025, CMS proposed to exclude CPT code 30469 from the list of \ndevice-intensive procedures, reporting a device offset percentage of 22.62 percent.   \n \n \n1 CPT code 30469: Repair of nasal valve collapse with low energy, temperature-controlled (i.e., radiofrequency) \nsubcutaneous / submucosal remodeling.       \n \nCMS-1809-P, September 9, 2024 \nPage 3 \n \n Based on our knowledge of the actual sales to hospitals in the United States, the proposed device offset \namount of $1,330.62 reported in Addendum P as part of the CY 2025 proposed rulemaking is \nunreasonably low.  We urge CMS to revisit this determination and to examine the data available for the \nfinal rule with an eye toward eliminating data that are erroneous.  We urge the Agency to adjust the \ndevice offset amount and device offset percentage upward to better reflect the true costs of the VivAer \nStylus device and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to this procedure.   \n \nThe single-use VivAer Stylus device had uniform pricing in the United States across hospitals and other \nproviders in 2023 at $1,950, which is supported by the valuation that CMS adopted for the direct \npractice expense of the VivAer Stylus under the 2025 physician fee schedule.2  As a percentage of the \nproposed payment level of $5,882.51 for APC 5165, CPT code 30469 warrants assignment to the list of \ndevice-intensive procedures based on the real-world cost of the VivAer Stylus device.   \n \nGiven the newness of this code, the best interests of Medicare beneficiaries would be served by ensuring \nan additional year for hospitals to learn how to properly bill for this procedure.  The Agency should \nassign CPT code 30469 to the list of device-intensive procedures and assign the device offset percentage \nbased on the $1,950 cost or at a minimum to the default level of at least 31.00 percent for an additional \nyear in CY 2025.  Such refinements easily fall within the logical outgrowth of the notice of proposed \nrulemaking. \n     \nIn the case of CPT code 30469, the evolving hospital data demonstrate a clear trend toward exceeding \nthe device-intensive threshold as hospitals gain more experience in billing for this therapy.  CMS has a \nsubstantial interest in ensuring that transient learning curves in hospital billing practices do not \nundermine patient access in the ASC setting and that CPT codes like 30469 do not seesaw in device-\nintensive status from year-to-year. \n \nWe urge CMS to consider that CPT code 30469 had device-intensive status during the prior year and \nthat hospitals are still learning how to bill for this new procedure.  In addition, we urge CMS to improve \nthe accuracy of the device offset amount for CPT code 30469 by aligning the device offset amount for \nan additional year with the valuation that CMS has adopted for the direct practice expense of the VivAer \nStylus under the 2025 physician fee schedule.3  This will ensure appropriate ASC payment while \nhospitals gain experience in properly billing the device costs associated with this service.  Failing to \nassign device-intensive status to this code in 2025 will undermine patient access to this important \ntherapy, especially in the ASC setting. \n \nII. CMS should finalize its proposal to assign CPT code 31242 to the list of device-intensive \nprocedures for CY 2025, and CMS should refine its proposal to reflect the full cost of the \nsingle use device that is integral and necessary to perform this surgical procedure. \n \nThe RhinAer Stylus is a transformative innovation in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery for the \ndestruction of soft tissue in the nasal airway, including in the posterior nasal nerve regions in patients \n \n2 Line 19108, CMS-1807-P_PUF_Supply.xlsx within the CY 2025 PFS Proposed Rule Direct PE Inputs (ZIP).

The RhinAer Stylus, which is an essential component for administering this \ntherapy, is used bilaterally, and must be discarded at the end of an individual patient’s procedure.  The \nAMA CPT Panel established CPT code 31242 effective January 1, 2024, which reflects the procedure \nperformed using the RhinAer Stylus.4  \n \nFor CY 2025, CMS proposed to assign CPT code 31242 to APC 5165 (Level 5 ENT Procedures).  We \nagree that this APC assignment will promote clinical and resource homogeneity because the clinical \ncharacteristics and resource costs of CPT code 31242 are very similar to other device-intensive ENT \nprocedures that are assigned to APC 5165. \n \nIn addition, we urge CMS to finalize its proposal to assign CPT code 31242 to the list of device-\nintensive procedures with a device offset percentage of 31.00 percent.  CMS has assigned CPT code \n31242 a device offset amount of $1,823.58 as set forth in Addendum P in the documents accompanying \nthe proposed rule.  Although we support the device-intensive status proposed for this code, we urge the \nAgency to increase the device offset amount and device offset percentage to better reflect the costs of \nthe RhinAer Stylus, which is an essential component for administering this therapy.  The RhinAer Stylus \nis used bilaterally and must be discarded at the end of an individual patient’s procedure.   \n \nCMS should improve the accuracy of the device offset amount for CPT code 31242 by aligning the \ndevice offset amount with the valuation that CMS has adopted for the cost of the Radiofrequency \nStylus/wand that CMS reports under Medicare’s direct supply practice expense data for the 2025 \nphysician fee schedule.5 \n \n* * * * * \n \nWe appreciate CMS’ continued commitment to working with stakeholders to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to advancements in technologies that address the unmet needs of Medicare \nbeneficiaries with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat.

Exaggerated conditions with polar and non -polar solvents, and both time and \ntemperature exceeding clinical use are very aggressive for limited contact devices. \nLimited contact devices such as catheters and delivery system often use a large \nvariety of materials to achieve required performance, and as a result, these \nexaggerate conditions can be incompatible, or generate extractables profiles that \nare not relevant to the clinical exposure.  \n2  458 Change to : it is recommended to perform chemical \nanalysis on each iteration of an exhaustive \nextraction, however, pooled extraction is allowed if \nthe total combined volume is used for the AET \ncalculation  and analytical method sensitivity \nensures LOQ \u003c AET.  Abbott has  received pre-sub feedback from FDA reflecting the suggested change in \nlanguage. FDA pre-sub feedback also states:  “FDA does not recommend pooling \nextracts from subsequent extraction cycle iterations (nth) prior to analysis due to \nchemical constituent dilution and underestimation concerns. When extraction \niteration cycle extracts are analyzed separately (no pooling), insight into the types, \namounts and kinetics of the leachable constituents and degradation products may \nbe gained.” Abbott believes that this is the best practice for chemical \ncharacterization, which ensures proper evaluation of device safety .  \nAlthough cycles are analyzed separately, total amount by summing all cycles are \nstill being reported and used for TRA.  \n3  699 Change to: When the chemistry extraction is \nperformed in triplicate preparation, NVR extraction \ncan be performed in single preparation, providing \nthe extraction condition is the same (e.g., solvent \nvolume, temperature, and duration).  NVR replicates  provide minimum val ue in understanding  variability. NVR is an \noverall measurement of the non -volatile extractables amount and is less sensiti ve \nand specific compared to chemistry analysis , where comparison of replicate data \ncan truly add value as documented in Section V.B  lines 336 -343.  \nA single  NVR preparation still provides adequate information on the exhausti ve \nendpoint and an overall estimate of the amount of non -volatile residues. It reduces \nthe cost burden to manufacture additional devices for the replicate NVR \npreparations.  \n4  763 Change to: If adequate recovery (e.g., 70 -130%) is \nnot achieved, you should take steps to improve \nrecovery.  For non -targeted analysis, 70 -130% is more appropriate criteria at the middle level \nof the calibration curve. Although spike and recovery is a targeted analysis, the \nsurrogate standards used for S/R still cover a broad range of physical chemical \nproperties. The screening methods are designed for a broad range of chemicals and \nmay not be optimized for every compound. 70% -130% provides adequate \nassurance that the sample processing methods do not result in significant loss of \nextractables compounds.  \n5  834 Change to: Direct inject ion of non -polar solvents \n(e.g. hexane) for LCMS analysis is acceptable , \nwhen it can be  demonstrated that chromatography Most reversed phase LC column s are compatible with non -polar solvents. Abbott  \nhas evaluated direct injection of small  volume s (e.g., ≤5 uL) of non -polar solvents \nfor LCMS analysis and demonstrated that method performance criteri a can be  met.    \n \n \nPage 3 of 3 \n \nChemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment of Medical Devices  [Docket FDA -2024 -D 4165]; Abbott Laboratories  Edit \n# Line #  Change  Reason  \nis not compromised, precipitation is not evident, \nand adequate recovery is achieved  (as \ndemonstrated through surr ogate standard \nevaluation)   \n6  376 Change to: 50 ºC with 72 -hour or 24 -hour cycles, \nprovid ed that  exhausti ve extraction  is \ndemonstrated.  Exhaustive extraction utilizing either 24 -hour or 72 -hour cycles will reach exhaustion \nas defined by ISO 10993 -18. Since the total exhaustive amounts are used for TRA, \nthe duration of each cycle has minimum impact to the TRA results. 24 -hour \nextraction cycles help avoid potential degradation of low abundance extractables \nfrom extended exposure to elevated temperature (e.g., 50  ºC), as well as saturation \nof high abundance extractables over longer extraction duration. Extracts from all \ncycles can also be analyzed more expediently.  \n \n7  976 Change to: Selected reference standards cover the \nRT range of the chromatographic separation  Instead of reference standards bracketing the RT range of all analytes, it is more \nappropriate and feasible to have reference standards cover the RT range. This \nmeans reference standards should have early, middle , and later RT. However, \nanalytes can occasionally elute earlier or later than the reference standards  RT \nrange.   \nWhen selecting a reference standard for semi -quantification, RT is only one of the \nconsiderations. The primary consideration (line 981) is chemical characteristics, \nwhich is the most impactful to the response factor variation.  When multiple suitable \nstandards exist, the lower responding one will be selected for a conservative \nestimation of the concentration (line 983). Therefore, when the analyte RT is slightly \noutside the RT range of the reference standards, the results of the semi -\nquantification are adequate for safety evaluation.  \n \n8  1309 Clarify QA/QC for identification  FDA expectations are unclear. Please provide additional clarification and/or \nexamples of QA/QC  approach es that FDA recommends for qualifying  chemical \nidentifications.  \n \n9  715 Change to: Use of a balance with sufficient \nsensitivity (readabilities of at least 0.1 mg and \naccurate sensitivity at 0.5 mg)  Abbott has received  pre-sub feedback from FDA reflecting the suggested change in \nlanguage. This change aligns with the current balance and NVR method capability. \nBalance capability and NVR method sensitivity are two different attributes. \nConsidering the NVR process involves evaporating large volume of solvents, the \nNVR method is typically capable of measuring 0.5 mg of residues with sufficient \naccuracy and precision using a balance with readability between  10-100 ug.  \n \n",

Medicare payment for DMHT devices will \nincrease Medicare beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based non-drug therapies for the most \ncommon mental health conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, \nand others.  \n \nBig Health’s mission is to help bring those with common mental health conditions back to good mental health. We do that by developing and distributing DMHT devices, which are digital \ntreatments featuring evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (“CBT”) techniques for \ncommon mental health conditions. Big Health has developed and distributes SleepioRx and \nDaylightRx and also has other DMHT products in development.  SleepioRx is a digital \ntherapeutic intended for the treatment of chr onic insomnia/insomnia disorder as an adjunct to \nusual care in patients aged 18 and older. SleepioRx is a prescription device delivering Cognitive \nBehavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) and can be made available on the order of a licensed \nhealthcare provider.  DaylightRx is a digital therapeutic (pending FDA clearance) that provides \nCBT for improvement of worry and anxiety in the management of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (“GAD”) in adults aged 18 years and older as an adjunct to their usual medical care.  Both \nproducts are designed to deliver a complete course of CBT, are backed by peer reviewed, \n \n1 89 Fed Reg. 61596 (July 31, 2024) (CY 2025 Proposed Rule). \n2 89 Fed Reg. 61596, 61742-61744 (July 31, 2024) (CY 2025 Proposed Rule). \nCMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 2 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  published, industry-leading clinical research3, and are regulated as software as a medical device \n(“SaMD”) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Beyond the US, Big Health also operates \nin the United Kingdom (UK), where the UK’s National Institutes for Health and Care Excellence \n(NICE)4 has recommended Sleepio as first line treatment on the basis of the clinical and \neconomic evidence.   \nWe applaud CMS’s proposal to establish coding and payment for DMHT devices furnished \nincident to a professional behavioral health service. This proposal will expand access to first-line \ncost-effective therapies for Medicare beneficiaries with mental health conditions for which \nDMHTs are available and indicated for use.  \n \nAs discussed more fully below: \n1. Big Health strongly supports CMS’s proposal to cover and pay for DMHT devices and \nrelated treatment management services. \n2. We applaud CMS’s proposal to create new HCPCS Codes for DMHT device services \nrecognizing that existing codes for remote monitoring do not describe therapeutic \ndevices and related services and do not reflect the resources required with furnishing \nDMHT devices. \n3. Big Health encourages CMS to establish national rates for GMBT1.  There are adequate \ndata sources to support national rate setting for GMBT1.  National rates will facilitate \naccess to DMHT as envisioned by CMS . \n4. We recommend minor, technical changes to the descriptors for the treatment \nmanagement codes (GMBT2 and GMBT3) to reflect the fact that DMHT devices \ngenerally do not generate data; the physician/qualified health care professional manages \ntreatment use of DMHT devices by considering information related to the use of the \nDMHT devices. \n5. Big Health also offers responses to each of the four questions posed in the Proposed \nRule regarding payment and coding for DMHT devices and treatment management \nservices. \n Our comments are set out in detail below: \n \n1. Big Health Strongly Supports CMS’s Proposal to Cover and Pay for DMHT Devices \nand Related Treatment Management Services \n \nMedicare beneficiaries often have difficulty accessing readily-available, high quality mental \nhealth treatment services. A study published by Milliman recently found significant gaps in care \nfor Medicare beneficiaries with GAD and insomnia. For example, although clinical guidelines \n \n3  https://www.bighealth.com/research/  \n4  Sleepio to treat insomnia and insomnia symptoms (nice.org.uk)   CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 3 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  recommend CBT as first-line treatment5,6 and discourage the use of hypnotics and \nbenzodiazepines in the elderly due to risks of adverse events7, only 7-percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries aged 65 or older with GAD and 3-percent of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or \nolder with insomnia received psychotherapy prior to filling a prescription for a benzodiazepine or \nan hypnotic.  The reasons for this gap between guidelines-based care and actual practice among Medicare beneficiaries are not fully clear, but appear to include limited availability of \npractitioners who are trained to provide CBT and the time and expense incurred by Medicare \nbeneficiaries to attend CBT sessions in-person.  This gap can be narrowed through distribution \nby physicians and other qualified health care professionals of high quality, evidence-based \nDMHT programs that help provide CBT to Medicare beneficiaries under the guidance and \nsupervision of the physician/qualified health care professional as part of a behavioral therapy \nplan. \n \nCMS’s proposal, if finalized, will give physicians/qualified health care professionals, including psychologists, primary care providers, and specialists new tools to fill these significant gaps in \ncare and expand access to evidence-based treatments. Big Health strongly supports the \nproposal to cover and pay for DMHT services that are furnished incident-to a behavioral therapy \nplan. More specifically, we support: \n● establishing separate codes for the (a) onboarding, education, and supply of the DMHT \ndevice (GMBT1), and (b) treatment management services that support their use \n(GMBT2 and GMBT3); \n● the design of the DMHT supply code (GMBT1) that includes onboarding, education and \naccess to the DMHT supply and is paid once per course of treatment; and \n● the design of the treatment management codes (GMBT2 and GMBT3) that reflect the \nprofessional services involved in managing treatment with the DMHT device as part of \nthe behavioral therapy plan. \n \nCMS’s multi-year rulemaking process starting with the request for information from the public \nregarding these services as part of the CY 2024 MPFS rulemaking\n8 and now followed by the \nproposal in this year’s Proposed Rule has resulted in a well-considered proposed policy that can be implemented in large part as proposed (with consideration of a few, technical suggestions, \nas discussed below). \n \n5  Wilson S, Anderson K, Baldwin D, et al.

Big Health Applauds CMS’s Proposal to Create New HCPCS Codes for DMHT \nDevice Services Recognizing the Differences Between Digital Devices Used \nPrincipally for Therapy--Not Monitoring \n Big Health agrees with CMS’s proposal to create distinct codes (proposed under Level II \nHCPCS) to report DMHT device services.  Al though AMA/CPT has adopted remote therapeutic \nmonitoring (“RTM”) codes to report furnishing of RTM devices that monitor  CBT services, the \nRTM coding structure is not appropriate for digital devices that principally are used as \ntherapy —not for monitoring. We believe strongly that CMS has followed the correct path by \ncreating specific codes for DMHT devices that are principally designed to furnish the therapy \nrather than monitoring.  \n \nThe RTM code set is used to report monitoring devices and related treatment management services designed to collect data from a patient about musculoskeletal therapy, respiratory \ntherapy, or in-person CBT treatments and to transmit those data back to the physician/qualified \nhealth care professional who is managing the patient’s course of care with these types of \ntherapy. These codes include initial set-up and patient education (code 98975), furnishing of the \nmonitoring devices themselves (codes 98976, 98977, 98978 for musculoskeletal therapy \nmonitoring, respiratory therapy monitoring, and CBT monitoring respectively), and treatment \nmanagement (codes 98980 and 98981).  These codes are used to report devices whose core functionality depends on data collection and transfer to the practitioner.  By contrast, these \ncodes are not used to report the associated musculoskeletal therapy, respiratory therapy, or \nCBT services.  Those therapy services are reported separately reflecting the resources required \nto furnish those treatments, which are distinct from the resources involved with monitoring.  \nSimilarly, the practice expense inputs for the RTM codes do not reflect the input costs for DMHT \ndevices, which are not dependent upon acquisition and transmission but rather function as \nadjuncts to therapy to induce changes in patients’ behavior and/or cognitive functioning.   \nAlthough CBT services furnished in-person may be reported under existing CPT codes (e.g., \n90834, 90837)\n9, there are no codes to report digital CBT or other DMHT therapy devices and \nrelated services.  Without the proposed HCPCS codes to report DMHT devices and related \nservices, currently there are no codes to report such services when furnished by \nphysicians/qualified health care professionals as part of a behavioral therapy treatment plan.  \n \nIn addition, the monitoring devices described by codes 98976 (respiratory), 98977 \n(musculoskeletal), and 98978 (CBT) are designed and distributed for 30-day periods given the \nwide variability in the duration of treatment for patients undergoing musculoskeletal therapy, \nrespiratory therapy, or in-person CBT treatment and therefore in the periods of time over which \nthe treating physician/qualified health care profe ssional would find monitoring information helpful \nin patient management.  By contrast, access to DMHT devices as adjunctive treatment \ncomponents of a behavioral therapy plan is often furnished for a course of treatment, which may \n \n9 90834 Psychotherapy, 45 minutes with patient ; 90837 Psychotherapy, 60 minutes with patient  CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 5 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  last for several weeks or months but rarely continues on a long-term basis for a single course of \ntreatment.  The physician/qualified health care pr ofessional who provides education and training \nto on board DMHT devices commonly incurs a one-time cost to furnish access to the DMHT for \na beneficiary over a single course of treatment.  The structure of proposed code GMBT1 fits \nnicely into this framework.    \nWe note that insofar as AMA/CPT has already closed applications for Category I codes for CPT \n2025 and CPT 2026, the proposed HCPCS Level II structure of codes GMBT1, GMBT2, and \nGMBT3 provides a timely opportunity to offer access to DMHT devices and related services for \nMedicare beneficiaries who need these services during 2025 and 2026.  The structure proposed \nhere can serve as the basis for potential future application to the CPT Editorial Panel for \nCategory I CPT codes that could then be adopted as early as CPT 2027.  In this regard,  \nBig Health has been working with the stakeholder community, including professional societies, \nto obtain Category I CPT codes for DMHT device services, and we look forward to continue to work with stakeholders on a longer-term coding proposal under CPT to report these services.   \n \n3. Big Health Encourages CMS to Establish National Rates for GMBT1.  There are \nAdequate Data Sources to Support National Rate Setting for GMBT1, and National \nRates Will Facilitate Access to DMHT as Envisioned by CMS in its Proposal \n \nAs noted above, Big Health strongly supports CM S’s proposal to establish coding and payment \nfor DMHT services furnished by physicians/qualified health care professionals incident to a \nbehavioral therapy plan.  However, we are concerned about the specific proposed policy to use \ncontractor pricing for the new code for the DMHT device supply, patient onboarding and \neducation. Under contractor pricing, CMS would delegate the determination of the payment rate \nfor GMBT1 to the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).  Unfortunately contractor pricing \ncan cause confusion, inconsistency in payment rate and cost sharing amounts, and potential \ndelays in coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, physicians/qualified health care professionals \nand device manufacturers. When rate setting is assigned to the MACs, it often takes time to \nestablish a local payment rate, and not infrequently, the initial rates set by the MACs are too low and must be adjusted to be adequate to cover provider costs.  These delays, in turn, delay \npatient access as providers are not likely to offer new services, like DMHT device services, until \nthey are confident that the rates are set and sufficient to cover their costs.  In addition, variation \nin rate setting among MACs can mean significant  differences in beneficiary cost-sharing by \nregion.  This may also impact access if cost sharing amounts are substantially higher for \nbeneficiaries in one region compared to another.  We fear contractor pricing could delay uptake \nof DMHT services by physicians/qualified health care professionals and result in continued gaps \nin care for Medicare beneficiaries with common mental health conditions. \n Instead, we recommend CMS establish national rate setting for GMBT1.  The MPFS \nmethodology accounts for physician/qualified health care professional as well as practice \nexpenses--both direct practice expenses (e.g., clinical labor, supplies and equipment) and \nindirect expenses (e.g., clerical payroll, office expenses and other expenses, such as rent and CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 6 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  electronic health records that support many or all of the services furnished by the \nphysician/qualified health care professional).  In terms of physician/qualified health care \nprofessional work involved with education and onboarding of the DMHT, we believe a crosswalk \nmay be made to the work involved with a low level office visit—i.e., 0.18 work RVUs (consistent \nwith code 99211).  In terms of practice expens es, GMBT1 involves (1) supply of the DMHT \ndevice and (2) clinical labor resources for onboarding and education on the use of the DMHT \ndevice (showing the patient how to access the DMHT, making sure that the patient knows how \nto use the program, responding to questions from the patient about use of the program and how \nand when to interact with the practice about the use of the DMHT as part of the behavioral \ntherapy program).  The DMHT device is acquired by the physician/qualified health care \nprofessional as a supply (i.e., an access code purchased on a per-beneficiary per-course of \ntreatment basis). These expenses are incurred uniquely for a specific patient’s treatment (rather \nthan as an underlying expense for running the practice), and the use of the DMHT device \nis consumed by a single patient.  \nBig Health provided invoices to CMS to support the development of national practice expense \ninputs for GMBT1. We encourage CMS to use these and other invoices that may be submitted \nfor DMHT devices to establish a national allowed payment rate for GMBT1. \n \nIn the Proposed Rule, CMS noted “The interested party submitted four invoices reflecting \nconsiderable variation in the cost of the DMHT treatment over 30-day and 90-day periods.”\n10 \nThe invoices actually were not for 30-day versus 90-day periods, but rather were either for a set \n30-day period or for a course of treatment “up to 90 days.”  This distinction is important.  Given \nsome uncertainty in how payers would reimbur sement DMHTs, two offerings were developed: \n(1) a 30-day period for payers who may limit coverage to 30-day periods requiring separate \nbilling for each period versus (2) a course of treatment, which typically is greater than 30-days \nbut less than 90-days.  The pricing for the course of treatment was intended to reflect an \naverage length of treatment—not a 90-day period. We note that the invoice amounts submitted \nare consistent with the average selling price reported by Pear Therapeutics for its FDA-cleared \nDMHT devices.11   \n \nIn the event that CMS believes the Agency is unable to use these invoices directly to develop a \nnational payment rate, we urge CMS to crosswal k the practice expense relative values (PE \n \n10 89 Fed Reg. 61743 (July 31, 2024) \n11 See Pear Therapeutics, Inc. Form 10-K for t he fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 at page 108 \nshowing an average selling price of $1,195 per prescription \n\u003chttps://www.sec.gov/Archiv es/edgar/data/1835 567/0001835567230 00018/pear-2 0221231.htm \u003e.  This is \nsomewhat higher than amounts shown in invoices submi tted earlier this year reflecting anticipated market \nconditions as more DMHT devices have become available.  Pear Therapeutics developed and \ncommercialized reSET (for the treatment of substanc e use disorder as monotherapy), reSET-O (for the \ntreatment of opioid use disorder in combination wi th buprenorphine), and Somryst (for the treatment of \ninsomnia).  Pear Therapeutics declared bankruptcy in 2023, and these three DMHT device assets were \nsold to other companies.  reSET and reSET-O are no w commercialized by Purs ueCare and Somryst is \ncommercialized by Nox Health. CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 7 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  RVUs) of GMBT1 to existing HCPCS codes to achieve the same goal. To identify potential \ncrosswalks, we calculated the estimated PE RVU for GMBT1 following the CMS methodology \nusing the following inputs: \n \n \nClinical \nLabor $ 25.92 based on 48 minutes of RN/LPN/MTA time (L037D), mirroring the \nclinical labor time used for 98975  \nEquipment $ 0.00 (no equipment) \nSupplies $ 800 (based on submitted invoices for a course of treatment) \nDirect 0.26163 (All Physicians) \nIndirect 0.73837 (All Physicians) \nIPCI 1.00 (All Physicians) \nPE RVU 23.20 (Calculated based on PE RVU model) \nWe then identified the following potential crosswalks with PE RVUs of approximately 23: \nCode Descriptor CY 2025 \nProposed \nRule PE RVU \n93456 TC Catheter placement in coronary ar tery(s) for coronary angiography, \nincluding intraprocedural injection(s) for coronary angiography, \nimaging supervision and interpretation; with right heart catheterization 23.12 \n93229 External mobile cardiovascular telemetry with electrocardiographic \nrecording, concurrent computerized real time data analysis and greater than 24 hours of accessible ECG data storage (retrievable with \nquery) with ECG triggered and patient selected events transmitted to a \nremote attended surveillance cent er for up to 30 days; technical \nsupport for connection and patient instructions for use, attended \nsurveillance, analysis and transmission of daily and emergent data \nreports as prescribed by a physician or other qualified health care \nprofessiona l 22.98 \n91111 TC Gastrointestinal tract imaging, intraluminal (eg, capsule endoscopy), \nesopha gus with interpretation and repor t 23.54 \n93453 TC Combined right and left heart catheterization including intraprocedural \ninjection(s) for left ventriculography, imaging supervision and interpretation, when performed 23.57 \n \nAlthough these codes do not describe FDA-cleared digital device services, they provide \nexamples of other technical services where the resource costs borne by physicians/qualified \nhealth care professionals are equivalent to those expended by physicians/qualified health care \nprofessionals for DMHT devices.  In particular, like GMBT1, code 93229 describes the technical \ncomponent of a device used in the home, including support for connection and patient \ninstructions for use. \n CMS took a similar approach, using crosswalk to establish a PE RVU for code 92229 in the CY \n2022 rulemaking cycle. CMS explained the approach as follows: CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 8 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  “We commonly employ a crosswalk to recognize resource costs when we lack the \ninputs that we would need to calculate work, PE, and/or malpractice RVUs for a \nservice otherwise. When we use a crosswalk to value a service, we substitute the \nestablished RVUs for other services with similar resource costs in the physician office \nsetting to set RVUs and the national payment rates for that particular service.”12 \n \nIn finalizing the crosswalk for code 92229, CMS noted: \n“[W]e continue to believe that our proposed crosswalk to CPT code 92325 is a more \nappropriate choice to use for valuing CPT code 92229 because it more closely \nmatches the RUC-recommended total direct PE costs for CPT code 92229 .”13 \n \nUsing this established approach, CMS can establish a national payment rate for GMBT1 based \non crosswalk, and we recommend the PE RVUs one of the codes above as these most closely \nmatch the practice expense input costs for GMBT1.  \nWe note that as part of its proposal, CMS identified the types of devices that could be \nconsidered DMHT devices as those cleared by FDA under the regulation at 21 CFR 882.5801. \nGenerally speaking, as discussed below in response to CMS’s questions posed in the Proposed \nRule, we agree with CMS’s approach as it establishes an appropriate and high standard for the \ntypes of devices that could be furnished and used by Medicare beneficiaries.  More specifically, \ndevices approved or cleared by the FDA under 21 CFR 882.5801 must meet specific requirements for clinical efficacy and safety , which distinguish DMHT devices that may be \nfurnished incident to a physician/qualified health care professional’s behavioral therapy plan for \nthe treatment of specific mental health diso rders from non-FDA cleared devices that may be \nused for wellness purposes or devices that may be acquired by patients over the counter \n(without prescription or physician/qualified health care professional order). However, we note \nthat when questioning the acquisition costs represented by the invoices CMS received for \nDMHT devices, CMS identified a website ( https://www.carepatron.com/app/cbt-therapy-apps ) \nthat offers digital products that are not approved or cleared by the FDA under 21 CFR 882.5801 \nnor similar to devices subject to that regulation. Rather the website pointed to a variety of what \nappear to be wellness products--not prescription medical devices that treat or manage a \nbehavioral or mental health condition.    \n \nWe believe CMS has adequate information to establish a national rate for GMBT1, and we \nstrongly encourage CMS to do so in the Final Rule. \n \n4. Technical Clarifications Regarding Codes GMBT2 and GMBT3 \n \nAs noted above, Big Health supports the three-part coding structure proposed by CMS in the Proposed Rule.  That said, we have a couple of minor clarifying comments about the treatment \n \n12 86 Fed Reg. 65039 (November 19, 2021)(CY 2022 Proposed Rule) \n13 Ibid. CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 9 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  management codes GMBT2 and GMBT3.  More specifically, the descriptors for these codes \nread as follows: \n \n \n  \nCode Descriptor \nGMBT2 First 20 minutes of monthly treatment management services directly related to \nthe patient’s therapeutic use of the digital mental health treatment (DMHT) device that augments a behavioral therapy plan, physician/other qualified health care professional time reviewing data generated from the DMHT device from \npatient observations and patient specific inputs in a calendar month and \nrequiring at least one interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the calendar month  \nGMBT3 Each additional 20 minutes of monthly treatment management services directly \nrelated to the patient’s therapeutic use of the digital mental health treatment (DMHT) device that augments a behavioral therapy plan, physician/other qualified health care professional time reviewing data generated from the DMHT device from patient observations  and patient specific inputs in a \ncalendar month and requiring at least one interactive communication with the \npatient/caregiver during the calendar month  \n \nWe are in agreement with the general structure of the treatment management codes and \nbelieve the proposed relative values represent a reasonable initial valuation for these codes.  \nWe note however, that DMHT devices generally do not generate data from patient observations \nor patient specific inputs.  The DMHT devices are therapy programs that patients access as part \nof their treatment.  For sure, the treating physician/other qualified health care professional \ninteracts with the patient over the course of a calendar month during which treatment is ongoing \nto inquire about the therapeutic use of the DMHT device as part of the behavioral therapy plan, \nbut that interaction does not typically involve transmission or review of data generated by the DMHT device.  We would recommend that CMS modify the descriptor by replacing the words “. \n. . reviewing data generated from the DMHT device from patient observations and patient \nspecific inputs in a calendar month” with “. . . reviewing information related to the use of the \nDMHT device, including patient observations and patient specific inputs in a calendar month . . . \n.“  This modification would more closely tr ack with how physicians/qualified health care \nprofessionals manage patients using DMHT devices as part of a behavioral therapy plan. \n \n5. Responses to Questions Posed in the Proposed Rule Regarding DMHT Device \nPayment \n \nIn the Proposed Rule, CMS posed four questions about coding, coverage, and payment for \nDMHT devices to which we would like to respond in these comments. \n  CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 10 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613   \n \na. Whether payment should be made if the practitioner furnishes a digital device \nthat has not been cleared by FDA for mental health treatment for a specific \nuse, even if the digital device has been cleared by the FDA for another specific use \n \nIf a device is cleared/approved by FDA for some mental health treatment use, then its use \nfor a different mental health treatment use should be eligible for coverage under the \nincident-to benefit provided there is published evidence supporting the use of the device for \nthe specific mental health treatment use for which it is ordered.  The MACs may request \nsupporting evidence for coverage of a device when ordered for an off-label mental health \nuse.   If the DMHT device is not cleared/approved by FDA for any mental health treatment \nuse, then it would not be eligible for coding/coverage under this proposal. \n \nb. Whether payment should be made for DMHT devices cleared by the FDA not \nonly under 21 CFR 882.5801 but also under other regulations  \n \nWe believe CMS’s reference to devices falling under 21 CFR 882.5801 is a good start and \nreflects a narrow, but clear, category of computerized behavioral therapy devices for \npsychiatric disorders.  As CMS notes in the Proposed Rule, the term “mental health disorders” is more appropriate than “psychiatric disorders” insofar as it does not connote that \nthe disorders for which DMHT devices would be appropriate are limited to conditions treated \nby psychiatrists.  In addition, the term “mental health disorders” is the more accepted current \nnomenclature. \n \nThe special controls under 21 CFR 882.5801 provide reasonable guardrails to assure CMS \nthat the DMHT devices that may be covered under this proposal include only devices for \nwhich safety and effectiveness have been determined and which are appropriate for use as \na part of a behavioral therapy plan for mental health disorders.  These controls include: (1) clinical data that describe a validated model of behavioral therapy and validation of the \nmodel as implemented by the device, (2) software controls meeting FDA’s software \nrequirements specification and software design specification as well as software verification, \nvalidation and hazard analysis, and (3) labeling controls including instructions for use, \ncompatible devices, a warning that the device is not intended as standalone therapy and is \nnot a substitution for the patient’s medication. \n \nThese things said, as this is an evolving area, CMS should consider some flexibility in \nallowing DMHT devices that may be offered under other regulatory classifications that FDA may adopt over time as long as these have appropr iate requirements for efficacy and safety \nand appropriate quality systems controls. \n CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 11 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  c. Whether and how payment might be limited if a patient discontinues use of the \nDMHT device before completing a course of treatment  \n \nThe course of treatment for a DMHT device may be variable depending upon the patient’s \nspecific diagnosis and the appropriate behavioral therapy plan developed by the physician/qualified health care professional for the specific patient.  As long as the patient \naccesses the DMHT device as prescribed or ordered by the physician/qualified healthcare \nprofessional and uses the DMHT as part of the behavioral therapy plan, the course of \ntreatment as contemplated by GMBT1 should be considered completed.  If a beneficiary \ndecides not to access the DMHT device at all, then it would not be appropriate to bill for the \nGMBT1 service.  Although the specific transactional relationship between the DMHT device \nvendor and the physician/qualified health care professional will determine whether or not the \nphysician/qualified health care professional can return and reuse the access code without \ncharge, we agree that neither the Medicare program nor the beneficiary should be charged if the DMHT device is never accessed.  If the patient does access the DMHT device but \ndecides to discontinue treatment with the DMHT device earlier than at the completion of at \nleast half of the prescribed or ordered course of treatment, then the GMBT1 code may be \nbilled with a reduced services modifier (-52), and the payment may be adjusted accordingly. \n \nd. Whether and how payment might be limited to a set number of DMHT devices \nper calendar month per patient  \n \nIt may be appropriate to limit payment to a single DMHT device at one time for any specific \nindication for use.  Insofar as patients may experience more than one mental health disorder \nfor which treatment with a DMHT might be appropriate and where the use of more than one \nDMHT is not precluded by the labeling for either DMHT, however, it may be appropriate to \npay for more than one DMHT device during the same treatment period.  That would \ntranslate into allowing more than one unit of GMBT1 to be billable during a single treatment \nperiod.  Codes GMBT2 and GMBT3 can accomm odate treatment management of multiple \nDMHT devices by considering the sum of the minutes involved with treatment management of all DMHT devices during calendar month to determine the appropriate billing of GMBT2 \nand units of GMBT3. \n \n *  *  *  *  * \n \nWe truly appreciate CMS’s recognition of the need for Medicare beneficiaries to have access to \nDMHT devices as adjuncts to a behavioral therapy plan in the management of beneficiaries with \nvarious mental health disorders.  The proposed coding for DMHT devices and treatment \nmanagement services related to these devices is a very important initial step in narrowing the gap between guideline-recommended treatment of patients with mental health disorders that \nrecommends cognitive behavioral therapy as first line versus current practice that relies more \nheavily on cognitive impairing pharmacotherapy.  Big Health strongly encourages CMS to adopt \nthe proposal in the Final Rule, establish national pricing for GMBT1 to ensure access to DMHT CMS-1807-P  \nAugust 27, 2024 \nPage 12 of 12 \n \n \n \nDM_HC 1712805-5.111336.0613  devices, consider our suggested edits to the nomenclature for GMBT2 and GMBT3, and \nconsider our comments responding to the four questions raised in the Proposed Rule. \n \nSincerely yours, \n /s/ \nJenna Carl, Ph.D. \nChief Medical Officer \nBig Health \n \n \n \n",

We recognize the value \nof PCCPs in modernizing the medical device framework and provide these comments to \nrealize the full extent of this authority.  These comments are focused on:  \n \n• Labeling,  \n• Special 510(k)s,  \n• 30-Day Notices, and  \n• Deviations from a n authorized protocol . \n \n \nLabeling  \nWe recommend clear guidance regarding the Information to include in labeling when a \ndevice is authorized with a PCCP.  Specifically, we recommend the guidance clarify it is \na best practice not to include information about an authorized PCCP in labeling prior to \nimplementing the authorized change.  This is consistent with current practice related to  \n  \n \nPage 2 of 3 \n pre-promotional activities.  To include information in labeling prior to implementation will \ndetract from required information contained in labeling .  User confusion may result from \ninformation about an authorized PCCP for a change that has not been and may not be \nimplemented. For these reasons, we recommend revising the guidance to remove \nrecommendations to include in labeling information about an authorized PCCP prior to \nimplementation is not recommended and  retain th e text  that advises against includ ing \nthis information  in labeling.  \n \n \nSpecial 510(k)  \nWe recommend the guidance recognize the Special 510(k) as an appropriate pathway to \nsubmit a new PCCP .  The draft guidance recognizes Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k) \npathways as appropriate for submitting a new PCCP  The Special 510(k) submission \ntype exists under the same statutory authority as the Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k) \nsubmission types1. Thus, the PCCP authorities apply equally to all 510(k) submission \ntypes and there is no statutory basis to differentiate Special 510(k)s from the other types \nof 510(k)s for purposes of submitting a new PCCP.    \n \n \n30-Day Notices  \nAs explained in the draft guidance, a 30 -day notice does not meet the statutory criteria \nfor submission of a new PCCP.  In discussions, the agency has noted a 30 -day notice \nsubmitted with a new PCCP will be converted to a 135 -day supplement to conduct the \nreview of the PCCP.  We recommend the agency add this information to the guidance \ndocument.  \n \n \nDeviations from an authorized protocol  \nThe draft guidance implies that any deviation from an authorized protocol is not \npermissible. Such an approach is not based in statute and is inconsistent with existing \nFDA policies, including least burdensome principles.  To ensure that the PCCP authority \nis implemented in a practical manner that is consistent with existing policies, it  is \nimportant  for the guidance to define a framework to allow for deviations from the \nauthorized PCCP  protocol . For example, an authorized PCCP in which the protocol is \nbased on an FDA -recognized consensus standard would be  considered a deviation , \naccording to the draft guidance, if the consensus standard undergoes a revision, even \nwhen FDA recognizes the revised consensus standard.  An expectation that a new \nsubmission would be filed to re -authorize the protocol with the FDA -recognized revised \nconsensus significantly limits the utility of PCCPs.  \n \nDevice modifications, including modifications subject to an authorized PCCP, are \nimplemented in accordance with the quality system regulations of which risk assessment \nis a core component.   A risk -based framework to assess a deviation from an authorized \nprotocol to determine if a deviation presents a new or increased risk compared to the \nauthorized PCCP impact assessment would be an appropriate mechanism to \ndifferentiate appropriate protocol deviations from deviations in which a new submission \nis expected.  \n \n \n1 Reference: The Special 510(k) Program guidance https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -information/search -fda-\nguidance -documents/special -510k -program    \n  \n \nPage 3 of 3 \n We recommend revising the guidance to incorporate a risk -based assessment to \nevaluate deviations from an authorized protocol consistent with the existing quality \nsystem regulations and upcoming quality management system regulations.  \n \n \nShould you have any questions, please contact me at ( 224) 66 7-8197 or via e -mail at \napril.veoukas@abbott.com.  \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n/s/ \n \nApril Veoukas, J.D.  \nDirector, Regulatory Affairs  \nAbbott Quality \u0026 Regulatory  \nAbbott Laboratories  \n",

Many of those in the standards-based medical device interoperability community participated in the meeting and found the update information very helpful.\nBefore the workshop, an industry perspective was submitted (see above reference) detailing the rationale for expanding the ASCA program to include medical device interoperability. Post workshop we remain just as convinced and committed to support such an expansion, and look forward to working closely with the FDA in coming months and years to achieve that goal.\nThe resulting impact of this program extension on the global medical device technology industry and on patient care will be a \"sea change\" and the realization of a 40+ year standards vision.\nWorkshop discussion topics that stood out to our group include:\n1. Standards that are \"regulatory submission ready\"\nThe ISO/CEN/IEEE 11073 standards and the HL7-IHE SDPi standard are all designed for use by regulatory agencies\n\" We look forward to the \"acid test\" and confirming + making needed adjustments - to make sure that regulatory ready is a reality and not just an aspiration\n2. Standards (and subject matter) that lend themselves to 2nd \u0026 3rd party testing\n· These device interoperability standards have been created for the highest acuity care contexts: Operating Rooms, ICU beds, Emergency Departments, etc.\n· These life-critical applications of medical device technology demand a high-bar of confidences that they will perform - together as plug-and-trust ensembles around a point of care - safely, effectively and securely\n\" This can only be achieved by 2nd \u0026 especially 3rd party testing\n3. Test Methods that support (1)\nPage 3\nIndustry Post ASCA Expansion Workshop comment for Device Interoperability (Docket No. FDA-2024-N-0645)\n· These have been in development and initial product using these methods have been or are in non-U.S. regulatory review\n4. Acceptance Criteria (integrated to (1) and (2)\n\" This is a core aspect of these ISO/CEN/IEEE 11073 standards + the SDPi standard, including the integration of requirements metadata directly in the specification\n\" The standards have been designed to support \"requirements interoperability\" enabling computable integration of requirements to test assertions (with criteria) to test cases\n· This results in standardized traceability and coverage determination from individual tests back to the requirements they are intended to verify\n5. Clarity on what problems CA \u0026 ASCA inclusion address (vs. just a good idea)\n· As stated in the pre-workshop device interoperability support proposal (see above), and reiterated below, FDA recognition of the SDPi standard and coordination of our CA program (which is required for our ecosystem without any consideration of possible regulatory benefit) with an expanded ASCA program will have a huge positive impact on the entire industry, and internationally. Instead of regulatory affairs being a completely different aspect of navigating product to market, it will be a known, well understood pathway component that will result in benefits to all stakeholders involved\nEspecially to patients who will benefit from the advances in safety and healthcare technology that result when plug-and-trust interoperability of acute care medical devices becomes the \"new normal.\"\nDuring the workshop, there were a few additional themes that particularly resonated with this community:\n1. Use of External Schemas\nAs explained in detail in the pre-workshop device interoperability paper (see above), the industry is actively working on the development of just such a conformity assessment schema that will also be \"regulatory submission ready\" - internationally, starting with European Notified Bodies \u0026 the U.S. FDA\nOur goal is to have active participation of all stakeholders, including regulatory agencies, to ensure that the resulting CA program provides the elements needed for confidence in the safe, effective and secure use of certified products in plug- and-trust systems. We applaud the FDA's active, in-person, participation in the March 2024 Gemini Ecosystem Pathway Summit (Stuttgart, Germany) where just such a CA program was discussed and a resulting multi-year roadmap is being created.\nWith the FDA's continued active engagement of this group - along with the other stakeholders - we are confident that just such an \"external schema\" can be\nPage 4\nIndustry Post ASCA Expansion Workshop comment for Device Interoperability (Docket No. FDA-2024-N-0645)\nrealized, meeting the needs of the agency but without it having to do all the \"heavy lifting\" and long-term maintenance.\n2. Schema Development via SDO or Similar\nThe development of the interoperability standards, as well as the creation of a conformity assessment program continues to be rooted in and managed by various standards development organizations (SDOs) and related non-profit organizations. These include the IEEE, ISO, IEC, HL7, and IHE. In fact, the \"Gemini Device Interoperability\" program is a joint effort between HL7 and IHE, and leverages the core ISO/IEEE/CEN 11073 core standards that are already recognized by the agency.\nA Gemini Device Interoperability Accelerator program is being created within HL7 to provide overarching governance (including funding) for execution of the roadmap that resulted from the aforementioned Stuttgart Summit. This roadmap will include the development of CA test tooling, comprehensive test cases, testing events, and ultimately a CA program that leads to certification of interoperable devices.\nThe FDA CDRH DSCA team has been actively involved in supporting the creation of these device interoperability standards, and is also considering possible participation in an accelerator program that will help ensure that the resulting CA program meets regulatory needs as well as general industry requirements.\nAgain, by working in concert with these SDO and non-profit industry organizations, the FDA will be able to realize the needed elements for a successful ASCA device interoperability (and cybersecurity) program, but without having to do all the work, plus manage and maintain everything.\nPage 5",

Pursuant to Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act \nof 1998 ( 19 US C. Section 3106 ) and as requested by this notice,1 we also include comments concerning the \noperation and effectiveness of US telecommunications trade agreement s. \n \nUSCIB is submitting combined comments regarding foreign trade barriers to US exports for 2025 reporting for \nthe following countries: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, \nCosta Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, European Union, \nFrance, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Korea (Republic of), \nMalaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Middle East and North Africa, Nepal , New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, \nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Taiwan, \nThailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Vietnam.  \n \nImportantly, our submission lists the proliferation of digital trade barriers  as the 1974 Trade Act  requires the NTE \nreport  to identify and analyze “significant barriers to, or distortions o f” US goods and services exports globally \nand, when possible, estimate the distortive impact they have on US  commerce . The United States leads the world \nin the development and deployment of the digital services and technologies  that support  manufacturers, \nhealthcare, retailers, wholesalers, professional and financial services providers and logistics firms  - not just big \ntechnology . All USCIB member companies in  these sectors  rely on the US to confront digital trade barriers, \npromote barrier -free data flows and  safeguard  legitimate access to digital products and services.  \n \nARGENTINA  \n \nInformation and Communications Technologies  \n \nPresidential Decree of Need and Urgency ( DNU ) 690 introduced major amendments to Law No. 27,078 which \nare: \n• All information and communications technologies services falling within the scope of such law, as well \nas the access to telecommunications networks for and between licensees, are now essential public services \nunder competition.  \n \n1 Office of the US Trade Representative, Request for Comments on Significant Foreign Trade Barriers for the 202 5 National Trade Estimate Report , \nFederal Register Vol. 8 9, No. 17 0, 71775  (2024).   \n \n 2 \n• Prices of such essential public services, as well as prices of the services provided under the Universal \nService, and prices of services determined by the enforcement authority (ENACOM) to be of public \ninterest, shall be regulated by such enforcement author ity. \n• ENACOM shall determine  the mandatory basic universal service to be provided under conditions of equal \ntreatment.  \n \nIn principle, when a service is qualified as a “public service ,” it means that there is a public  interest  involved in \nits provisions. Therefore, it would be subject to stronger regulations of the National Government and to Public \nLaw principles aimed at guaranteeing users’ access to  such services. Nonetheless, the extent of the Government’s \ncontrolling and regulatory powers depend on the regulatory framework applicable to the service.   \n \nWe recommend differentiating  between the consumer and enterprise markets.  Services that cater to enterprise \ncustomer markets are categorically different from those offered to mass -market retail service customers, such as \nresidential subscribers, in accordance with the needs and requirements for each type of customer.  \n \nBecause the negotiating power between large enterprise customers and telecom service providers is relatively \nbalanced or tilted in favor of large business customers, the regulatory protections that may be necessary for mass -\nmarket retail subscribers are un warranted in the enterprise customer scenario.  Whereas mass -market retail \nsubscribers typically seek basic voice and data packages, large enterprise customers often require a more complex \nand specialized suite of services. Mass -market retail subscribers ca n select from a range of standard service offers. \nWhile they can choose from a wide selection of plans that suit their needs, mass -market retail subscribers do not \nnegotiate contracts and special conditions on a customer -by-customer basis. All mass -market retail subscribers \ncan choose from the same standard plans.  \n \nIn contrast, enterprise customers demand individualized contract terms with tailored technical, security, and \nnetwork requirements under service level agreements (SLAs).  Large enterprise customers possess the expertise \nand bargaining power to negotiate with providers on a relatively equal and sometimes dominant basis. In many \ncases, enterprise customers even issue a tender process to select a provider on a competitive basi s. Regulations \nthat fail to recognize the distinction between consumer and enterprise users impose unnecessary compliance \nburdens and challenges to enterprise service providers and pose a barrier to the growth of new and innovative \nservices.  \n \nCable providers maintain their ability to compete by providing bundled services, whereas bundles of telecom \nservices with direct -to-home s atellite services  are restricted . In addition, although satellite pay-TV providers \ncontinue to be regulated by the Media Law, cable providers are expressly excluded from that law and are now \ncovered by the Telecommunications Law.  \n \nTo achieve lasting reform and to promote greater investment and competition in the telecommunication and media \nmarkets, the Argentine government should work to remove regulatory barriers.  Such legislation will ensure equal \nregulatory treatment of all participants in this rapidly converging industry.  The rapidly converging \nTelecommunications and Media segments need a legal, regulatory, less fragmented , and long -term approach.  \nUSCIB urges USTR to request that the Argentine government promote regulation that e stablishes convergent free \nmarket principles, equal regulatory treatment , and the respect for Argentine Trade commitments with the United \nStates.  \n \n   \n \n 3 \nExtended Timelines for Pre -Shipment Licenses  \n \nImports to Argentina are subject to pre -shipment licenses for certain IT and telecommunication goods. There are \ntwo types of licenses: 1) Automatic license – approved within 2 -3 days; 2) non-automatic  license – approved \nwithin 7 -10 days. In 2021 , the Argentine Government published a regulatory change through the AFIP (Federal \nAdministration of Public Revenue and Customs) and SIECyGCE (Secretary of Industry, Economy , and Foreign \nTrade Administration) establishing an increase of response time from 10to 60 day s, which can delay inbound \nshipment activity.  \n \nImport Policy  \n \nIn 2016, the G overnment of Argentina  implemented the Comprehensive Import Monitoring System (SIMI) to \npromote competitiveness and facilitate trade, while maintaining sufficient controls to manage risks.  The SIMI \nestablished three different low -value import regimes (Postal, Express, and General). However, given the \nchallenges that persist in clearing goods through the General import regime, only the Express Courier regime \nworks functionally for e -commerce  transactions. Thus, the limit within the Express regi me creates serious \nroadblocks for US companies seeking to export to Argentina. The Express regime limits shipments to packages \nunder 50 kilograms and under $1000, with a limit of three of the same items per shipment, with duties and taxes \nassessed. While import certificates  and/or  licenses for products are not required, the government limits the number \nof shipments per year per person to five, which is strictly enforced. US companies have had to stop exporting to \nArgentina altogether given the complexities within the General regime and the inability to know how many \nshipments a customer has already received.  \n \nImport -Restrictive Currency Controls  \n \nIn 2022, Argentina issued new laws (Communications 5271/2022 and 7622/2022) that expanded licensing \nrequirements to all imports. The laws establish a new framework (\"SIRA\"), under which each import requires \napproval by multiple government agencies based on a review of the importer's proposed payment method, tax \nstatus, and financial capability (among other details). For transactions in US dollars, the process has increased \napproval lead times from 3 -15 days to approximately 60 days, preventing businesses fr om operating at speed. \nMoreover, if shipment information changes between approval and entry into Argentina, importers may need to \nreapply for the approval.  \n \nRegarding services (such as legal, cloud, software licenses, etc.), the Central Bank implemented an online process \nto manage the requests to access the FX market to make cross -border payments for imported services called \n“SIRASE” (Sistema de Importaciones de la República Argentina y Pagos de Servicios al Exterior). In April 2023, \nthe Central Bank further tightened the FX controls and required that the Central Bank, the Secretary of Commerce \n(Secretary), and the Argentine Tax authority approve all requests t o access the FX market to make cross -border \npayments for imported services (known as a SIRASE request). The Secretary has up to 60 days to respond to a \nSIRASE request, which may be extended for an additional 60 days if the Secretary requests additional \ninformation.  \n \nArgentina’s Impuesto Pai has been a long -standing restriction to trade, as it only applies to imports of goods and \nservices. In July 2023, Argentina issued a decree (Decree No. 377/2023) that imposes new value -added taxes on \nimports and related services paid with US dollars  (USD) . With limited exceptions, the decree imposes a 7.5% tax \non imports under most tariff classifications, for which payment is in U SD. In effect, a single import could trigger \nan additional tax of up to 15% solely on the basis that its  purchase and transport is paid in USD.  In mid -September  \n \n 4 \n(2024), the government lowered the tax rate of Impuesto Pais only targeting goods, which seems insufficient as \nthe decision does not include transactions paid with credit cards.   \n \nTariff Barriers  \n \nSince 2009, Argentina has applied a 21 percent VAT on information technology and electronic products, including \nmobile phones, cameras, and tablets produced outside the Special Customs Area within Tierra del Fuego province. \nAdditionally, imports of these e lectronics products were subject to a 35 percent import duty, and imports of \nelectronic components were subject to a 12 percent duty. While Decree 117/2017, issued in 2017, eliminated the \n35 percent duty on imports of a subset of electronic devices, and th e 12 percent import duty on electronic \ncomponents , tariffs remain on other products, including mobile phones. Decree 864 issued in 2018 modified the \nlist of NCM tariff codes subject to the special treatment for Telecommunication goods and Decree 973/2018 set \na 0 percent  Extra Zone Import Duty for certain goods.  \n \nDecree 332/2019, in force from May 7, 2019, to December 31, 2019, temporally increased from 0.5  percent  to \n2.5 percent  the statistics fee tax rate set forth in Section 762 of the Customs Code and suspended exemptions set \nforth in Sections 26 and 27 of Decree 690/2002 and amendments thereto (goods original from MERCOSUR, new \nfix assets and informatics and telecommunication  goods). Decree 332/2019 stated the following caps to statistics \nfee (cap that until the time of its issuance amounted to USD 500):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation  \n \nArgentina and all others WTO Members who have ratified the WTO T rade Facilitation Agreement  (TFA) should \nbe encouraged to support G/TFA/W/25, “Supporting the timely and efficient release of global goods through \naccelerated implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement” along with the current WTO members of: \nAustralia; Brazil; Canada, Colombia,  Ecuador; the EU; Iceland; Japan; Republic of Korea; Mexico; Montenegro; \nNew Zealand; North Macedonia; Norway; Singapore; Switzerland; the Separate Customs Te rritory of Taiwan, \nPenghu, Kinmen and Matsu; Thailand; the UK; the US; and Uruguay . Members should be encouraged to join the \ndelegations of Brazil, Costa Rica, the EU, Norway, Switzerland, and the US, in supporting G/TFA/W/38, a \ncommunication related to “Revisiting the need for global action to eliminate consular requirements.”  2 \n \nArgentin e Customs detains shipments in \"channels\" when it has a question about the shipment or import \ndocumentation (yellow channel) or decides to perform a physical inspection (red channel). Argentine Customs \noften detains such shipments for up to one year, even a fter all inspections are complete and the importer answers \nall inquiries, resolves any discrepancies,  or disputes, and pays any fines imposed. This practice causes significant \ndelays  to delivery timelines, creating disruption and unpredictability in the supply chain. It also imposes costs on \nimporters, who may need to reorder goods and incur additional fees for storage.  \n \n \n2 This is a recommendation that is not limited to Argentina and should be viewed as consistent comment for those countries that  have ratified the \nWTO TFA.  Taxable base  Statistics Fee Cap  \nLower than USD 10,000  USD 150  \nBetween USD 10,000 and USD 100,000  USD 2,500  \nBetween USD 100,000 and USD 1,000,000  USD 25,000  \nBetween USD 1.000.000 and USD 5,000,000  USD 125,000  \nUpper than 5,000,000  USD 125,000 (SIC)   \n \n 5 \nSubsidies  \n \nArgentina  has a tax -exempt trading area called the Special Customs Area (SCA), located in Tierra del Fuego \nprovince. The SCA was established in 1972 through Law 19,640 to promote economic activity in the southern \nprovince. The SCA program, which is set to expire at the end of 382038, provides benefits for established \ncompanies that meet specific production, exportation, and employment objectives. Goods produced in Tierra del \nFuego and shipped through the SCA to other parts of Argentina are exempt from some local taxes and benefit \nfrom reductions in other taxes. Additionally, capital , and intermediate goods imported into the SCA for use in \nproduction are exempt from import duties. Goods produced in and exported from the SCA are exempt from export \ntaxes. Some products are brought from outside Argentina to facilities in the SCA where the y are taken apart and \nreassembled for sale inside Argentina to qualify for tax benefits.  In light of the 2019 WTO Dispute Settlement \ndecisions WT/DS472/R and WT/DS497/R, Argentin a should revise its SCA.  \n \nPrice Controls  \n \nOn March 2021, Argentina launched a  price control mechanism (SIPRE – Sistema Informativo para la \nImplementación de Políticas de Reactivación Económica) that monitors monthly prices and quantities sold for \nmore than 1,000 companies in construction and retail.  \n \nRestrictive Patentability Criteria  \n \nIndustry is concern ed about  the Argentine Government’s 2012 guidelines which amended the criteria for granting \npharmaceutical patents.  The restrictive guidelines refuse pharmaceutical patents for: compositions and \nformulations, salts, esters and ethers, polymorphs, active metabolites and pro -drugs, enantiomers, selection \npatents and certain Markush -type claims - almost 80  percent  of all pharmaceutical applications.  The ability to \npatent new technologies  is a crucial factor driving innovation.  Strong IP prot ection lowers barriers to the timely \nlaunch of innovative medicines and provides an incentive for companies to launch their newest and most \ninnovative products.  In Argentina, the imposition of additional patentability criteria for pharmaceutical patents \nbeyond those of demonstrating novelty, inventive step and industrial application is inconsistent with Articles 1 \nand 27.1 of TRIPS, as well as Argentina’s obligati ons under its bilateral investment treaty with the United States.   \n \nArticle 70 of A rgentin a’s law 27541 (December 2019 ) gives the Ministry of Health the right to establish a \nmechanism to monitor the price of drugs and health supplies, as well as to make direct importation of such goods, \nand implement compulsory licenses in case of lack of an adequate supply or unreasonable and/or unjustified \nincrease in the price which might affect the access of the population to medicines, putting the public health at risk.   \n \nAUSTRALIA  \n \nNews Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code  \n \nIn 2021, the Australian Government passed the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code .3 \nUnder the Code , designated platform services companies are required to engage in negotiations with Australian \nnews publishers for online content. The Bargaining Code specifies that the Australian Treasurer is responsible for \ndesignating platforms. When designating platfo rms, the Treasurer must consider whether the platform holds a \nsignificant bargaining power imbalance with Australian news media businesses. The Treasurer must also consider \n \n3 The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 2021, “Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and \nDigital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Bill 2021”, 20177b01.pdf;fileType=application/pdf (aph.gov.au) .     \n \n 6 \nif the platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through \nagreements relating to news content of Australian news businesses. If negotiations break down, or an agreement \nis not reached within three mon ths between a news business and designated platform, the bargaining parties would \nbe subject to compulsory mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, the bargaining parties would proceed with \narbitration, with arbitrators seeking to determine a fair exchange  of value between the platforms and the news \nbusinesses. In addition to the negotiation and arbitration requirements, the Bargaining Code imposes information \nsharing requirements ,4 including a requirement that platforms provide advance notice of forthcoming changes to \nalgorithms if the change is likely to have a significant effect on the referral traffic for covered news content. To \ndate, no platform has been designated, although the  Code is under ongoing annual review by the Treasurer ...5 In \nview of the news publishers are integral to media coverage of elected officials ; the process has been politicized.  \n \nUSTR should continue to pay close attention to the implementation of the Code and its adherence to the principles \nof transparency, fairness, and non -discrimination as consistent with the US -Australia FTA.  \n \nProposed Investment Obligation for Streaming Services  \n \nAustralia’s Minister for the Arts Tony Burke is consulting on a bill targeted at US streaming providers, which \nwill require them to invest at least 10% of their local program expenditure on creating new Australian drama \nprograms. The definition of Australian content is still uncertain but  will likely be very difficult to meet. It would \nalso include additional sub -quotas, including to produce children’s content – even if the streaming provider does \nnot produce that sort of content. This is discriminatory against US businesses, because the level of obligation \nbeing proposed is higher than the current scheme that applies to Australian subscription TV services. Additionally, \nthe expenditure percentage increases with the number of subscribers – 1m-3m is 10%; 3m -5m is 15 %; 5M+ is \n20%. There is su spicion that this is a design feature aimed at keeping the investment obligation to 10% (or possibly \n15%) for local streaming services. An obligation in this form could put Australia in breach of its obligations under \nthe Australia -United States Free Trade  Agreement. The government can only impose measures if Australian \ncontent is not readily available to Australian consumers. This is clearly not the case given the large investments \nin Australian content that US streamers are already making.  \n \nTelecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act  \n \nThe Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act of 20186 grant s the country’s national security and law \nenforcement agencies additional powers when dealing with encrypted communications and devices.7 It authorizes \nthe Australian government to use three  tools to compel assistance from technology companies in accessing \ninformation within electronic communications.  These tools are technical assistance requests (TARs), which seek \nvoluntary assistance from communications providers; and technical assistance notices (TANs) and technical \ncapability notices (TCNs).  These tools call upon providers to do one or more specified acts which could include \nbuilding new technical capabilities as required by the Attorney General.  \n \n \n4 ALRC. “Sharing Information.” Accessed July 26, 2022. https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/for -your-information -australian -privacy -law-and-\npractice -alrc-report -108/14 -the-costs -of-inconsistency -and-fragmentation/sharing -information/.  \n5 “Review of the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code | Treasury.Gov.Au.” Accessed July 26, 2022. \nhttps://treasury.gov.au/review/news -media -digital -platforms -mandatory -bargaining -code.  \n6 Affairs, Home. “Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018.” Accessed July 26, 2022.  \nhttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00148/Html/Text, http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00148.  \n7 Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018, Parliament of Australia, \nhttps://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6195.   \n \n 7 \nGovernment -Imposed Content Restrictions and Related Access Barriers  \n \nAustralia amended its Criminal Code8 in 2019 to establish new penalties for Internet and hosting services that fail \nto provide law enforcement authorities with details of “abhorrent violent material” within a reasonable time or \nfail to “expeditiously” remove and cease hosting this material.9 In 2021,  Australia introduced its Online Safety \nAct (OSA) with regulatory guidance (“Basic Online Safety  Expectations”).  While the stated intention of the OSA \nis to protect vulnerable individuals from unlawful, terror -related, and abhorrent violent content, the law also \nregulates a range of fully lawful content, creating a potential for government censorship and barriers to trade in \ncontent and related digital services.  The OSA grants broad powers to Australia’s e -Safety commissioner, which \ncan mandate —without public consultation —the scanning and removal of content by private market participants.  \nThe unbalanced approach of  the OSA and related guidelines also raise concerns about user privacy and the \nintegrity of encrypted communications.  \n \nCritical Infrastructure Reforms  \n \nAustralia announced major changes to its critical infrastructure framework, with the Security Legislation \nAmendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill 2020.10 The Government’s stated objective was to “protect the essential \nservices all Australians rely on by uplifting the security and resilience of our critical infrastructure . It significantly \nexpands the sectors considered critical infrastructure (including companies that provide “data storage or \nprocessing ” services  or carrier service provider se rvices ) and impose additional positive security obligations for \ncritical infrastructure assets (including risk management programs and cyber incident reporting), enhanced cyber \nsecurity obligations and, most concerningly, government assistance measures that enab le Australian government \nagencies to require critical infrastructure entit ies to install monitoring software on their networks, to “take control ” \nof an asset or to follow directions of the Australian Signals Directorate.  \n \nUS companies have actively opposed the extent of the reforms, particularly the government assistance measures, \narguing they go beyond what is necessary for action by the government in the data storage or processing sectors  \nor carrier service provider services .  \n \nIn 2021, the Australian government passed an amendment to SOCI that  \n \n• expands the scope of the currently covered sectors - “Critical Infrastructure Sectors” (Sectors) - to a total \nof 11 and the number of CIA classifications from four to 22 including the telecommunications sector , \n• introduces the new concept layer of “Systems of National Significance” (SONS) , and  \n• sets out new supplier obligations and government rights.  \n \nElectronic Surveillance Reform (ESR)    \n \nWe support Australia’s efforts to streamline the legal framework regarding electronic surveillance , but it must be \ndeveloped in close consultation with industry to minimize the risk of unintended consequences and to ensure the \nnew framework does not impose unnecessary additional costs.      \n      \n \n8 AG. “Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Act 2019.” Accessed July 26, 2022. \nhttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019A00038/Html/Text, http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019A00038.  \n9 Criminal Code Amendments (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019,  \nhttps://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1201.  \n10 Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra corporateName=Commonwealth. “Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastr ucture) Bill \n2021.” Text.

Australia should continue to allow for a free \nflow of information across geogra phic borders to allow organizations’ maximum participation in the global \neconomy.  \n \nATO Draft Taxation Ruling on Royalties – Character of Receipts in Respect of Software  \n \nIn 2021, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued a draft taxation ruling (TR 2021/D4) that proposed an \nupdated domestic interpretation of what constitutes a “royalty” and considered certain software payments made \nby distributors and resellers, including t hrough updated methods of software delivery, as royalty, subject to \nwithholding tax in Australia. While TR 2021/D4 would be a reinterpretation of domestic copyright law, its result \nis in fact a significant departure from global norms regarding the tax c haracterizations of software payments made \nby distributors and resellers. The ATO does not consider its view to be out of step with its taxing rights under the \nDouble Taxation Avoidance Agreements (“DTAA”) (including with the US) and is expected to apply t his new \ninterpretation to the US -Australia DTAA as well.   \n \nSpecifically, Australia’s long -standing guidance, TR 93/12 – Income Tax: computer software (which was \nwithdrawn in July 2021 , with the release of draft TR 2021/D4) makes clear that a payment by a distributor for a \nlicense of a simple use of software does not constitute a royalty if it is licensed to end -users, as the distributor is \nnot exploiting a software copyright right. The simple use of software means that a licensee or end -user is using \nthe product as intended (and therefore not using the copyright in  the software). This is the approach taken in the \nOECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and related commentary, which acknowledges that \n“distributors are only paying for the acquisition of the software copies, not to exploit any right in the s oftware \ncopyrights,” and therefore relevant transactions should not be treated as royalties.  \n \nTR 2021/D4, however, expands  the scope of payments made by distributors and resellers of software that may \nconstitute a royalty. Under the approach in TR 2021/D4, a distributor/reseller is considered exercising an ancillary \n“authorization” copyright right in a software program, even though the copyright owner has not granted any of \nthe principal copyright rights in the software (e.g., modify, reproduce, etc.) to the distributor. Certain customary \ncommercial elements of computer software distributor and rese ller arrangements (e.g., authorizing the user to \ndownload software onto its server) would be considered as the distributor or reseller exercising a copyright right \nrather than transferring a copyrighted article or providing a service.  \n \nAs drafted, TR 2021/D4 does not appropriately distinguish between the income tax treatment of payments for \nacquiring copyrighted software and payments for exploiting copyright rights in such software. It reverses long -\nstanding and internationally settled t ax treatment of software payments which has far reaching consequences for \nthe U nited States and global tech industry.  \n \n   \n \n 9 \nHosting Strategy Certification Framework  \n \nIn 2019, the Australian Government released the Hosting Strategy, providing policy direction on how government \ndata and digital infrastructure would enable the Digital Transformation Strategy, focused on data center facilities, \ninfrastructure, data storage  and data transmission. In 2021, the certification framework for the policy was released \nto operationalize the Hosting Strategy. The certification requires hosting providers, data center operators and \ncloud service providers to allow the government to spec ify ownership and control conditions. The framework has \nthe impact of imposing data localization and data residency and personnel requirements on all protected -level \ndata and data from whole -of-government (WGA) systems.  \n \nBANGLADESH  \n \nData Protection Act  \n \nThe zero draft Data Protection Act (the Act) mandates that classified, sensitive and user -generated data must only \nbe stored in Bangladesh and imposes very significant barriers to cross border data flows. These requirements are \nexacerbated by serious issues with definitions of key concepts. Contrary to global norms, the draft Act applies \nobligations to all data— not just personal data — irrespective of whether it relates to an identified or identifiable \nindividual. The Director General of the Data Protection  Agency has discretion to designate any data as “classified \ndata”, which under the Act, cannot be transferred out of Bangladesh. “Sensitive data” is more broadly defined \nthan similar concepts under global privacy laws ( e.g., it includes financial, genetic and biometrics data). “User \ngenerated data” would encompass any data and content created by a person or group of persons for limited use \nand sharing; we are not aware of such a concept being contained in any other global pri vacy laws.  \n \nThe very narrow circumstances where cross -border data transfer is permitted for sensitive and user -generated data \nare likely to be unworkable for most global companies and require the Director General to be notified in relation \nto each cross -border transfer. Given these wide and open -ended definitions, this proposal cou ld seriously impede \ncross border data flow and free trade. The data localization requirements are ineffective at enhancing the \nprotection of personal data, and would significantly increase co sts for US firms, potentially deterring market entry.  \n \nThe Act requires data controllers to disclose data when directed by the Director General. Given the scope goes \nbeyond the personal data, the disclosure obligation would apply to proprietary and business -sensitive data with \nno judicial or due process oversi ght. Compounding these issues is the fact that the Director General can impose \nfines of up to 5% of a company’s annual turnover for non -compliance and, very significantly, specifically states \nthat employees can be held personally liable for breaches of the  draft Act.   \n \nDigital Payments Market  \n \nAs the Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Bank prioritize digital payments as a conduit for financial \ninclusion for Bangladeshi citizens and small businesses towards building a SMART nation, we urge USTR to \nensure that any forthcoming regulations or p olicies allow for the full participation of US payments firms on a \nlevel playing field in the market. A primary concern is Bangladesh Bank’s position as both regulator and market \nparticipant in the National Payment Switch (NPSB), a state -owned domestic com petitor.  \n \nIn recent years, Bangladesh Bank has introduced several draft policies that would impose requirements to route \ncertain payment transactions over local infrastructure, as well as require all cards in the market to bear the logo \nof NPSB’s brand – although th ese regulations have been held in abeyance. Until now, only ATM transactions were  \n \n 10 \nrouted through the NPSB. However, Bangladesh intends to expand the system and, at present, appears to be \nrequiring certain point -of-sale transactions, such as Bangla QR, to be routed through the system.  \n \nTowards realizing its goal of achieving payment sovereignty, in June 2023, Bangladesh Bank (BB) announced its \nplan to launch a domestic scheme, named “TakaPay,” and has decided to launch a taka -rupee based “TakaPay” \ndebit card from November. In a related d evelopment, BB launched bilateral settlement with India in BDT -INR. \nWhile this was initially launched for trade payments, BB intends to extend this to cover card -based transactions \nfor the Bangladesh -India corridor.  \n \nSubsequently, BB signed a 6 -year agreement with the France -based consultancy firm, “Fime,” to help develop \nthe domestic scheme, set up a certification framework, and provide testing services. Recently, BB called for an \nopen tender, inviting bids from quali fied entities to provide support for the EMV Technology Specification \nSoftware License and related services for domestic schemes. This will enable BB and its participants to issue \nTakaPay mono -badge cards and co -badge cards with any international payment b rand.  The recent announcement \nof the Visa Policy to Promote Democratic Elections in Bangladesh by the US has instigated the faster \nimplementation of the domestic switch.  \n \nThe Bangladesh Payment and Settlement Bill, 2024, which was passed by the Bangladeshi parliament on July 2, \n2024, stipulates that any payment system operator would be required to obtain a license from the Bangladesh \nBank to offer services within the countr y. \n \nOur request to USTR remains the same: monitor policy and regulatory changes that may favor local brands. \nAdditionally, we urge the Bank of Bangladesh to consult with US payment companies as it develops policies \naimed at creating a robust, secure, and inclusive ecosystem for digital payments, e -commerce, and financial \ninclusion.  \n \nDigital Security Act  \n \nThe Digital Security Act of 2018 criminalizes a wide range of online activity, creating challenges for Internet -\nbased platforms and digital media firms. The Act criminalizes publication of information online that hampers the \nnation, tarnishes the image of the state, spreads rumors, or hurts religious sentiment. The Act provides for criminal \npenalties up to $120,000 and up to 14 years in prison for certain infractions.  \n \nRegulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms  \n \nThe Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) introduced the Regulation for Digital  \nSocial Media  imposing  restrictions on the creation and dissemination of online content, lacking  clarity around \ndefinitions, obligating  mandatory local registration and data retention requirements, lacking  a clear safe harbor \nprovision and introduc ing traceability, which would require businesses to break end -to-end encryption. There are \nno clear definitions of ‘over -the-top’ or ‘video -on-demand’ and what constitutes ‘official data ,’ ‘public data’ or \n‘breach of Government secrecy .’ The Regulation does not define ‘misinfo rmation’, ‘disinformation’ and ‘fake \nnews’, therefore risks arbitrary or subjective interpretation by individuals that would have a cascading effect on \nfreedom of expression, privacy , and fundamental rights of the people. Breach of the Regulation provides criminal \npenalties up to approximately US$ 30 million and up to 5 years in prison.  \n \n   \n \n 11 \nInformation and Communication Technology Act and the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Act  \nDigital Trade Barriers  \n \nIn 2022, Brazilian’s Congress introduced Bill 2768, inspired by the European Union’s Digital Markets Act \n(DMA), that designates the National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) as the primary regulator of “digital \nplatforms” in Brazil. The bill also establi shes a regulatory framework for the organization, functioning, and \noperation of “digital platforms” that offer services to users in Brazil. The bill uses vague terminology and does \nnot clearly describe the specific requirements needed to comply. Instead, i t grants ANATEL significant \ndiscretionary authority to define terms and create rules. While the vague language in the bill makes it hard to \ndetermine the specific obligations that would apply to US companies, but overall, the bill would at minimum \nincrease  compliance costs and may require the restructuring of business operations.  \n \nTelecommunications  \n \n• Promote Government Transparency/Regulatory Streamlining and Modernization : The current regulatory \nframework in Brazil includes long and complex decision -making processes that negatively impact telecom \noperators by increasing technical, marketing, sales, and information technology (IT) costs. To encourage \neconomic growth, Brazil s hould promote the replacement of the existing framework with a digital single \nmarket that better harmonizes federal, state, and municipal policies and practices to foster Brazilian \ncompetitiveness at a global level. A predictable legal regulatory environme nt that promotes long -term \ninvestment, innovation and enhanced competition should address the following:  \no Simplify telecommunications licensing processes : Currently, Brazil’s telecommunications \nregulator, ANATEL , assigns 14 different types of service licenses, many of which are technology -\nspecific and entail particular licensing procedures and requirements. By contrast, countries like the \nUnited Kingdom have instituted general authorization regimes that cover all  services, independent \nof technology, with General Conditions of Entitlement (that is, conditions which apply to all \nservices) and specific conditions (that is, conditions which apply to individuals) and have \nsimplified the process to obtain authorizations. Similarly, Latin American countries like Mexico \nand Colombia have also instituted unified concession or licensing regimes that allow for the \nprovision of convergent services. Currently, there is an ongoing consultation (Public Consultation \nNo. 41) on how to further simplify the licensing framework in Brazil; according to the draft rules, \nANATEL  would establish a unified licensing regime, i.e. a single license to operate all \ncommunications services av ailable to the public.  We strongly encourage ANATEL  to accept and \nimplement this proposal in an effort to simplify and streamline the regulation of \ntelecommunications services, among other actions.  \no Permit resale of local wireless services by non -Brazilian operators : ANATEL should consider \nadopting policies to permit resale of local wireless services by non -Brazilian operators, with a \nsimple licensing process, in line with the established practices in many countries around the world.  \no Reduced tax burden for telecommunications sector : According to a 2020 Global System for Mobile \nAssociation (GSMA) study, the tax and regulatory fee contribution of the mobile sector in Brazil \n(2018) represents 38 percent11 of total market revenue, compared to the Latin America regional \naverage of 18 percent. The largest source of tax revenue from the mobile sector is state VAT (64 \npercent of total tax payments made by the sector), followed by COFINS (11 percent) and FISTEL \nfees (7 percent).12 This has a severe dampening effect on mobility and broadband deployment, and \nimportantly, on the adoption of these services. Such high taxes and fees have a regressive impact \n \n11 GSMA, Mobile taxation in Brazil: Supporting digital transformation, 2020, GSMA -Mobile -taxation -in-Brazil -EN-2020.pdf.  \n12 Ibid.  \n \n 12 \non the adoption of services, particularly for lower income consumers. It is crucial that taxes on the \ntelecommunications sector are reduced to spur investments in broadband and mobile infrastructure, \nand to facilitate the adoption of services by consumers.  \n \nWe are encouraged that ANATEL’s  Board approved a study to examine the telecom sector’s \nsignificant contributions to government funds. The study, to be sent to relevant ministries, focuses \non tax system evaluation, proposed reduction in the tax burden to enhance service affordability \nand accessibility. ANATEL  has advocated for tax system simplification amidst ongoing \ndiscussions on tax reform, though the Administration’s response remains uncertain.  \n \no Quicker authorization for network deployment : Local authorities have typically required a license \nto deploy antennas and fiber networks and the Brazilian association of telecoms operators, \nConexis, has raised concerns that licensing requirements and the related lengthy approval process \nmight slow down  network deployment and potentially jeopardize compliance with coverage \ntargets. Recognizing these concerns, Brazil should adopt legislation that would authorize network \ndeployment if local authorities do not decide on a permit request within 60 calendar d ays. \n \nIn December 2023, the Urban Development Committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a \nbill that seeks to simplify the process for obtaining licenses to install  telecommunication \ninfrastructure in Brazil. The proposal assigns licensing to ANATE L and would allow licenses to \nbe requested online and also addresses such issues as the need to apply for the license and potential \nregulatory fees to cover administrative costs. The proposal must be analyzed by other government \nagencies before final approv al. \n \nConformity Assessment Requirements  \n \nANATEL requires testing of telecommunications products and equipment by (i) third party testing facilities \naccredited by the National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality (INMETRO) or by (ii) \nthird party testing facilities accredited under Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) and that have entered int o \na memorandum of understanding with Brazilian certification bodies (those entities responsible for issuing the \nequipment’s certificates).  The only exception is in cases where the equi pment is too large and too complex  to \ninstall , in which case the certification body may request an authorization to have the equipment tested in the \nmanufacturer’s own lab if the lab complies with certain standards.  As a result of these requirements, US \nmanufacturers and exporters must present virtually all their information technology and telecommunications \nequipment for testing at laboratories located in Brazil before that equipment can be placed on the Brazilian market, \nwhich causes redundant testing, reduced product choice, higher costs , and delayed time to market. This advanced \ntesting and review process can take several months and severely delay or  possibly impede market entry.  \n \nResolution 715 of  2019, issued by ANATEL, which revoked Resolution 323, brought the end of the charges for \nthe issuance of the homologation certificate, according to Section 58 of the Resolution. The tax exemption is valid \nfor all telecommunication products approved by ANAT EL including radio equipment, drones and imported \nproducts for personal use. The equipment approval process is subject to the verification of technical standards and \nlaboratory tests to ensure that the products are properly tested and approved for use in B razil. The Resolution also \nincluded ANATEL’s powers to designate a Foreign Certification Body (OCD) when there is a Mutual Recognition \nAgreement between Accreditation Bodies (Countries) and a Memorandum of Understanding between the \nCertification Bodies inv olved.  \n \n   \n \n 13 \nThe United States has urged Brazil to implement the Inter -American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) \nMutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with respect to the United States. Under the CITEL MRA, two or more \nCITEL participants may agree to provide for the m utual recognition of conformity assessment bodies and mutual \nacceptance of the results of testing and equipment certification procedures undertaken by those bodies in assessing \nthe conformity of telecommunications equipment to the importing country’s techn ical regulations. The United \nStates and Brazil are both participants in CITEL. If Brazil implemented the CITEL MRA,  as requested by the \nUnited States,  it would benefit laboratories in both countries that could test the other country's specifications, \nsuppliers seeking to sell telecommunications equipment globally, and consumers who would have access to new \ntechnologies and products more quickly. With respect to the United States, implementation of the MRA would \nbenef it US suppliers seeking to sell telecommu nications equipment in the Brazilian market by allowing  them to \nhave their products tested in the United States to Brazil’s technical requirements, eliminating the need for such \ntesting at laboratories in Brazil.  \n \nFurther, we urge USTR to raise this issue during other appropriate opportunities and consider alternatives that are \navailable to achieve ANATEL’s  desired outcome.  USCIB encourages the Brazilian and US governments to \nconsider negotiation of an agreement to streamline the testing process.  \n \nANATEL issued a new regulation  which included updates for evaluating the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for \ntelecommunications products.13 This SAR regulation was not notified to the WTO before its entry into force but \nfinally notified in April 2021 and put under public consultation in WTO; however, its entry into force was not \nsuspended nor was the regulation reissued considering the comments made during the consultation.  \n  \nCurrently, there are only two accredited laboratories for SAR testing, which creates bottlenecks for testing new \nproducts and may cause time -to-market delays. Industry has repeatedly asked the IFT to accept interim certificates \nand/or international test re ports until the testing laboratory infrastructure is sufficiently established and robust in \nthe country.  \n \nUSTR should stress the need to properly notify changes to technical requirements to allow appropriate notice and \ncomment and provide sufficient time for manufacturers to accommodate them. It should also note the potential \nlink between the SAR regulation an d existing Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) under the USMCA \nframework.  \n \nNetwork Usage Fee  \n \nANATEL launched a consultation exploring the possibility of requiring over -the-top providers to bear the cost of \nthe development of telecom infrastructure in Brazil. ANATEL’s consultation echoes calls by European and \nBrazilian telecommunications companies to require six US companies to directly pay telecommunications \noperators to support infrastructure development. Introducing an internet levy to subsidize local \ntelecommunications companies would have significant consequences for the digital economy and wou ld directly \ndiscriminate against US  companies who are already significantly invested in Brazilian networks and internet \ninfrastructure. ANATEL’s consultation ran from March - August 2023. Despite strong opposition to the idea of a \nnetwork fee through the consultation, ANATEL is expected to p ush forward with the proposal.   \n \n  \n \n13 GMA Consulting Group, “Brazil Updates Specific Ab sorption Rate Testing Procedure for Telecom Products,” (April 26, 2021), https://www.gma.trade/news/brazil -\nupdates -specific -absorption -rate-testing -procedure -for-telecom -products?e27cb8f4_page=71   \n \n 14 \nElectronic Payment Service s \n \nIn the past few years, the Brazilian Central Bank’s (BCB) role as a regulator and a competitor has created a \nconflict of interest. The BCB’s Competitiveness and Market Structure Department (Decem) oversees not only the \ndevelopment of policy that affects al l payment schemes in the Brazilian market, but also the development and \nregulation of PIX, a real -time payment scheme (including its participation rules and licenses), which went live on \nNovember 16, 2020. All Brazilian financial institutions with over 500 ,000 accounts were mandated to participate \nin the PIX scheme by November 2020.  On June 15, 2020, U.S. payment networks partnered with WhatsApp and \nlaunched a new payments solution to enable WhatsApp users in Brazil to transfer money and pay businesses. \nHowever, the BCB immediately suspended the payments program by abruptly modifying the payments regulation \n(through BCB Circular 4031 dated June 23, 2020), without notice or opportunity for public comment. Since then, \nthe Central Bank's conflict of interest b etween a regulator and a product manager has intensified. Given the over -\nregulated environment of Brazil's payments industry, the Central Bank controls time to market, and can determine \nsector economics. Additionally, the Central Bank has been increasingly  delegating supervisory functions to \nindustry players instead of undertaking these itself.  \n \nSubsidies  \n \nBrazil provides tax reductions and exemptions on many domestically produced ICT and digital goods that qualify \nfor status under the Basic Production Process (Processo Produtivo Básico, or PPB). The PPB provides benefits \nfor the production and development o f goods that incorporate a certain minimum amount of local content. Tax \nexemptions are also provided for the development and build -out of telecommunications broadband networks that \nutilize locally developed products and investments under the Special Taxati on Regime for the National Broadband \nInstallation Program for Telecommunication Networks (Regime Especial de Tributação do Programa de Banda \nLarga para Implantação de Redes de Telecomunicações, or REPNBL -Redes).   \n \nTax exemptions have also been provided for exports under the Regime for Predominantly Exporting Companies \n(Programa destinado a empresas predominantemente exportadoras, or PEC) , the Special Regime for the Purchase \nof Capital Goods for Exporting Companies (Regime Especial de Aquisição de Bens de Capital para Empresas \nExportadoras, or RECAP)  and the Special Taxation Regime for the Export of Information Technology Services \nPlatform (Regime Especial de Tributação para a Plataforma de Exportação de Serviços de T ecnologia da \nInformação, or REPES).  The government has also subsidized local technology production through incentives \navailable under the Informatics Law (Lei de Informática); the Semiconductors Incentive Program (Programa de \nApoio ao Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Indústria de Semicondutor es e Displays, or PADIS); the Digital TV \nDevelopment Program (Programa de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Indústria de Equipamentos para \na TV Digital, or PATVD); the Incentives for Technological Innovation Act (Le i de Incentivo à Inovação \nTecnológic); and the Digital Inclusion Program (Programa de Inclusão Digital, or PID).  \n  \nWTO Dispute Settlement decision WT/DS472/R and WT/DS497/R found that policies requiring the production \nof final products in Brazil established pre -conditions for producers to obtain tax benefits that imposed a higher \nburden on foreign producers than domest ic producers. This resulted in different levels of taxation and impaired \nthe ability of imported products to compete in the market. The decision also found that the rules governing \naccreditation for domestic production of inputs, requiring firms to perform  a minimum number of production \nsteps in -country, constituted WTO -inconsistent local content requirements.  \n  \nIndustrial policies for the information technology sector (as well as the automotive and other sectors) continue to \nenjoy a high level of domestic support among some sectors of the domestic business economy. Nonetheless, Brazil \nshould revise these industri al policies to bring them into compliance with its WTO commitments.   \n \n 15 \n \nImport License  \n \nThe imports of products that require import licenses in the current Brazilian licensing system face challenges \nmainly related to the time it takes to issue the license, which does not keep up with the agility for shipments. \nFurthermore, air shipments are c onsolidated with thousands of other products that do not have import licenses, \nand as the licenses are per product and per shipment, a product that requires licensing would interrupt the shipment \nand delivery of several other products to consumers. Brazil should offer the possibility to issue an import license \nby product through a process that requires only the information similar to that in the product catalog: informing \nthe product and manufacturer without the need to specify commercial data. It is also c rucial to extend the validity \nof the import license to meet the term from 6 months to 1 year, and to be used in several shipments with no limit \nof quantity (only time).  \n \nLocal Content Requirements  \n \nVarious countries – including Brazil – have proposed or adopted policies that require the use of local content in \ntheir telecommunications sector infrastructure. Governments often pursue such policies in order to boost their \nrespective domestic manufacturing sectors even though these policies undermine that long -term objective. \nBuilding a globally competitive and sustainable manufacturing sector and ensuring world -class service suppliers \nin telecommunications and in sectors that use such services are key go als of most countries. International \nexperience demonstrates that to achieve these goals countries should adopt open, market -oriented policies that \nencourage the establishment of manufacturing facilities that can be incorporated into global supply chains. \nPolicies that discriminate against imported products, in contrast, discourage firms from establishing new \nmanufacturing facilities since such facilities would be outside global supply chains.  \n \nPolicies requiring the use of local content also raise questions of consistency with trade rules, including provisions \nof the GATT and the WTO Agreement on Trade -Related Investment Measures (TRIMs).  \n \nLocalization Barriers  \n \nPast Brazilian governments’ interventionist policies have prevented innovation and technological progress. To \nensure access to innovation and to modern technology, Brazil should be open to the provision of products and \nservices from other nations. In addition to removing the local content requirements detailed above, Brazil should \nrepeal the following laws that serve as barriers to trade : \n \n• Provisions that offer government procurement preferences for goods and services that employ technology \ndeveloped locally or have been produced pursuant to the Basic Production Process (Article 3rd of Law \nNo. 8248 from October 23, 1991 ). \n• The Basic Production Process that establishes as a condition to the grant of a specific benefit the \nemployment of goods/machines produced locally, or technology developed locally.  \n• CERTICS Decree (Decree No. 8186, of January 17, 2014), which stands at odds with the global nature of \nthe software industry.  \n• The Margin of Preferences Decrees (Decree No. 8184, January  17, 2014, Decree No. 8194, February 12, \n2014, and Decree No. 7903, from February 12, 2013) , which grant ICT Equipment and Information \nTechnology and Communication Equipment preference margins in government procurement .14 \n \n14 Presidential Decree 8135 of November 5, 2013 was revoked by Presidential Decree 9.637 of December 26, 2018.   \n \n 16 \n• And ANATEL Resolution 155, on August 16, 1999, which “Approves the Telecommunications Operators' \nEquipment or Materials Purchasing and Services Contracting Regulation”, specifically applied to \ntelecommunication equipment, materials , and services. This Resolution provides further discipline on \nclauses included in the Concession Contracts and Authorization Terms.  It requires the provider to base its \npurchase/contracting decisions in a way that gives preference to services offered by companies located in \nBrazi l or for equipment and material produced in Brazil . \n• Other localization barriers reported include tax incentives for locally sourced information and \ncommunications technology (ICT) goods and equipment,15 government procurement preferences for local \nICT hardware and software,16 and non -recognition of the results of conformity assessment procedures \nperformed outside of Brazil for equipment connected to telecommunications networks.17  \n• Industry reports that cloud services are also required to have some types of government data localized \nunder recent revisions to the Institutional Security.  The Presidency Institutional Security Group (GSI), led \nby a military, published a  Normative Instruction  which establishes new rules for the contracting of cloud \nservices by the Federal Public Administration. It established requirements for data and metadata residency \nexclusively in national territory in a few situations that are red flags for US digital services providers.  \n \nThese measures disrupt the global nature of the ICT industry and disadvantage both access to technology in \nBrazilian and the ability of US ICT companies to do business in Brazil.  Furthermore, they disadvantage firms that \nprovide services to the Brazilian public sector but do not have the capacity to store data locally, and these \nguidelines set concerning precedents.  \n \nAI Bill \n \nBrazil’s Congress is moving quickly to pass a first of its kind bill regulating artificial intelligence (AI) that would \nrepresent a significant departure from the US-led risk -based approach to AI governance and hinder the \ntechnological competitiveness of US companies. Bill 2338/2023 has received overwhelming criticism from civil \nsociety, the businesses community, and academia, who argue it would negatively impact Brazil’s economy and \ninnovation environment, as well as international interoperability. The bil l will severely restrict US AI developers \nand other US businesses deploying AI -powered innovation from exporting their tools and services to Brazil, \ndelivering a harmful blow to leading US innovators that are in fierce competition with Chinese technology \ncompanies. Worryingly, the bill applies a blanket approach to AI regulation that does not narrowly focus on high -\nrisk use cases and instead captures low -risk applications, including everyda y business functions. Among other \nissues, the bill does not clearly differentiate between the developer and the deployer of high -risk AI systems, \nwhich threatens to significantly impede the ability of businesses of all sizes from developing innovative AI \napplications. The bill also contains copyright provisions that go way  beyond what any other country is proposing. \nIt would force developers to pay for any Brazilian content used to train AI models, which would essentially \nprevent generative AI features from being developed or used in Brazil.  \n \nDigital Trade Barriers  \n \nIn November  2022 , Brazilian’s Congress introduced Bill 2768, inspired by the European Union’s Digital Markets \nAct (DMA), that designates ANATEL as the primary regulator of “digital platforms” in Brazil. The bill also \nestablishes a regulatory framework for the organization, functioning, and operation of “digital platforms” that \noffer services to users in Brazil. The bill uses vague terminology and does not clearly describe the specific \n \n15 Basic Production Process (PPB) – Law 8387/91, Law 8248/91, and Ordinance 87/2013. \n16 2014 Decrees 8184, 8185, 8186, 8194, and 2013 Decree 7903. \n17 ANATEL’s Resolution 323.   \n \n 17 \nrequirements needed to comply. Instead, it grants ANATEL significant discretionary authority to define terms \nand create rules. While the vague language in the bill makes it hard to determine the specific obligations that \nwould apply to US companies, but overall, the bill would at minimum increase compliance costs and may require \nthe restructuring of business operations.  \n \nNetwork Usage Fee  \n \nANATEL  is interested in imposing a network fee tax that a small group of US content providers and technology \ncompanies would have to pay to large internet service providers to fund telecommunications infrastructure. \nANATEL  is running a series of consultations to justify such a fee based on a false narrative on the impact of these \nUS companies on network traffic. However, rather than being a burden on telecom infrastructure, the content and \nservices provided by innovative US companies are exactly why consume rs pay ISPs for internet in the first place. \nANATEL’s  approach discounts the existing investments of US companies in Brazilian telecommunications \ninfrastructure and will force US companies to artificially subsidize local companies, which in some cases are their \ncompetitors. This will be a significant financial hit to US companies and make them less competitive versus \nforeign technology firms. Following closure of their most recent consultation, ANATEL’s  lead on this issue will \nnow analyze submissions and a develop position to present to the board of the agency. The position is very likely \nto be a formal network fee proposal. Then, this draft proposal will be submitted to another public consultation, \nwhich will likely happen by the end of 2024.  \n \nData Economy  \n \nThe Department of Innovation of the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Trade (MDIC) is considering \npolicies and legislative proposals related to the “data economy” modeled after the European Union’s Data Act, \nwhich impose discriminatory obligations on US companies regarding the use of non -personal data. Although a \nformal proposal has not been released, there will likely be a public consultation on the matter by the end of the \nyear with questions about how Brazil should implement a similar Data Act in th e country. There are concerns that \nthis proposal could unfairly target US companies through specific thresholds.  \n \nTax Burden Audits Discrimination  \n \nThe excessive tax burden on telecommunications services in Brazil coupled with ANATEL’s complex, lengthy, \nand discretionary process of inspections, audits, and penalties lead to extremely high and onerous compliance \ncosts and risks for foreign digital services companies relative to their local Brazilian competitors.  As elsewhere, \nforeign communications companies that do not build out their own infrastructure typically focus on offering Value \nAdded Services (VAS) in Brazil.  ANATEL recognizes that VAS revenue s should not be assessed by regulatory \nfees such as FUST and FUNTEL (types of Universal Service contributions).  However , ANATEL’s failure to \nadopt and communicate a consistent criterion  for classifying services as taxable or exempt,  its common practice \nof initially considering the totality of a company’s revenues as telecommunications revenues , and the lack of a \nstatutory timeframe for audit completion, result in legal uncertainty, onerous financial risks/costs , and an overall \nobstacle for US companies to o ffer VAS in Brazil . \n \nVarious Discriminatory Policies in the Media and Entertainment Sector  \n \nBrazil maintains a variety of discriminatory policies in the media and entertainment sector, primarily led by the  \n \n 18 \nregulator, ANCINE.  Brazil imposes local content quotas in the pay television sector.18 Even more discriminatory , \na portion of Brazil’s local content quota must be filled by content in which local producers own the underlying \nIP. In an era where cable and satellite providers have the technology to offer their customers hundreds of channels \neliminating any concept of “scarcity ,”,” these quota requirements are an anachronism and clearly protectionist \nwhile restricting  the choices available to Brazilian consumers . Brazil also has sought to tighten its screen quotas \nto favor local films and limit the number of screens available to consumers for wide releases.  Also, ANCINE has \nsought to impose special taxes and local content quotas on V OD distribution of films and non -commercial and \ndiscriminatory requirements in the digital cinema space.   \n \nDe Minimis  \n \nBrazil’s de minimis  threshold (the level below which no duty or tax is charged on imported items) of USD $50 \nremains applicable only to postal shipments and limited to the Consumer -to-Consumer transaction (C2C) and \ndoes not apply for both Business -to-Consumer (B2C) and Business -to-Business (B2B) transactions.  There is a \nlegal controversy related to the way the rule is being construed; there exists some case law stating t hat the \nexemption should apply for both B2C and C2C transactions and that the de minimis  threshold should be raised to \nUSD $100. This differentiated treatment of the threshold between transactions and the low de minimis  threshold \nfor imported items into Brazil of USD $50 (contrary to the United States which is $800 USD) creates unnecessary \nbarriers to trade through increased transaction costs for Brazilian businesses and acts to restrict consumer choice \nand competition i n the Brazilian market. The Brazilian Government should remove this barrier to trade by \nexpressly extending the application o f the de minimis  threshold to both  postal and express delivery shipments and \nto B2C and B2B transactions and to increase the de minimis  threshold to a rate more in line with international \nstandards and consumer shopping behavior.  \n \nBrazil has already moved forward in its trade facilitation policy, by implementing the new Single Window project \nfor imports and exports. The goal  is to reduce the average time of customs procedures, by implementing one \nintegrated system, cutting bureaucracy and paper requirements. The creation of the Product Catalog is part of this \nproposal to reduce the import time. It is a database of products and  foreign operators,  with the  objective to increase \nthe quality of the product description, with information o rganized in attributes, attaching documents, images and \nphotos that help the administrative treatment, inspection , and risk analysis. The e -commerce particularities should \nbe considered within this process to guarantee a simplified process for products bought online. It is crucial that \nthe government considers the e -commerce contributions to the public consultation op ened to review the list of \nattributes and ensures that businesses have proportional time to adapt to these new requirements.  \n \nPharmaceuticals  \n \n• Regressive taxes on medicines:  Combined federal and state consumption taxes account for 31 percent of \nthe cost of medicines in Brazil, one of the highest tax burdens on medicines in the world compared to the \nglobal average of six percent. It is higher than those of any OECD country. Hig h tariffs and consumption \ntaxes can prevent access to new treatments for patients that need them. Under the WTO Pharmaceutical \nAgreement, 34 countries agreed to eliminate import duties on a wide range of medicines and other h ealth \n \n18 Brazilian content means content that: (i) is produced by a Brazilian producer, directed by a Brazilian director or foreign di rector residing in Brazil \nfor more than 3 years, and features at least 2/3 of Brazilian artists and technicians or aliens residing  in Brazil for more than 5 years; (ii) is produced \nby a Brazilian producer registered with ANCINE, jointly with companies based in other countries with which Brazil has signed co-production \nagreements (provided that such contractual provisions have been ob served); or (iii) is made, under co -production regime, by a Brazilian producer \nregistered with ANCINE jointly with companies based in other countries with which Brazil has not signed co -production agreements, as long as at \nleast 40 percent of property righ ts are assured to the Brazilian producer, and featuring at least 2/3 of Brazilian artists and technicians or aliens residing \nin Brazil for more than 3 years.   \n \n 19 \nproducts. However, the majority of Latin American economies, including Brazil, are not parties to the \nWTO Pharmaceutical Agreement. Between 2006 and 2013, the value of worldwide biopharmaceutical \ntrade in countries that are not parties to that Agreement in creased at a compound annual growth rate of \nmore than 20 percent. This means that a larger proportion of medicines distributed around the world are \npotentially subject to tariffs. To help remedy this trend, Brazil should accede to the WTO Pharmaceutical \nAgreement.   \n• Restrictive government pricing and reimbursement policies: The Ministry of Health Drug Market \nRegulation Chamber regulates the pricing and reimbursement of medicines in Brazil in a manner that often \ncreates market access barriers for non -Brazilian companies and prevents timely patient access to new \ntreatments and cures. Key barriers include delayed pricing decisions, government price ceilings on \ninnovative medicines sold to private and public purchasers as a condition of market entry, delays in new \nmedicine  price definitions, price increases capped below inflation despite rising production costs and rigid \nhealth technology assessment requirements by the National Committee for Technology Incorporation that \nprevent more flexible and value -based approaches to e valuating and paying for health care. Overall, just \n36 percent of new medicines launched globally since 2012 are available in Brazil . Less than 10 percent of \nnew medicines launched globally from 2011 -2020 are reimbursed by Brazil’s public health program.   \n• Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) and government purchasing: Brazil has developed a regulatory \nframework for the establishment of PDPs. While this framework provides improved transparency, Brazil \nstill lacks clear rules regarding the purchasing prefe rences offered to PDPs. In addition, while the Ministry \nof Health (MoH) is tasked with reviewing and approving PDPs, it does not consider the patent status of \nproducts that are the object of a PDP proposal submitted by third parties.   \n• Patent backlogs: Patent backlogs cripple innovation, hinder economies, impede job creation and frustrate \nthe launch of new products. Historically, patent applicants in Brazil have experienced some of the longest \npatent pendency times in the world. The issue persists today,  with a recent analysis finding that the average \npatent examination timeline for biopharmaceutical patents granted between January 2020 and March 2022 \nis 10.25 years. Patent offices in OECD countries (e.g., United States and Korea), China,  Europe , and other \neconomies have an average patent pendency period of 2 -4 years.  \n• Regulatory data protection failures: Although Brazil applies RDP for veterinary, fertilizer, and \nagrochemical products, the same protection is not provided to biopharmaceutical products.  The provision \nof RDP is required by TRIPS. RDP is also a standard provision in bilateral and regional trade agreements \namong and with OECD countries. Brazil, however, has no system at all to protect test or other regulatory \ndata for biopharmaceutical prod ucts for human use, even though Brazil has a system in place for \nveter inary, fertilizer and other agrochemical products. In fact, Brazil explicitly carves biopharmaceutical \nproducts out of its RDP law.  \n• Patent Reform: Patent backlogs cripple innovation, hinder economies, impede job creation and frustrate \nthe launch of new products. Historically, patent applicants in Brazil have experienced some of the longest \npatent pendency times in the world. AA recent analysis f ound  that the average patent examination timeline \nfor biopharmaceutical patents granted between January 2020 and March 2022 is 10.25 years. Patent offices \nin OECD countries (e.g., United States and Korea), China, Europe and other economies have a n average \npatent pendency period of 2 -4 years.  Further complicating matters, the Brazilian Supreme Court’s 2021 \ndecision eliminating the sole paragraph of Article 40 of the Patent Law, which ensured a minimum patent \nterm of 10 years from the date of patent grant in Brazil, leaves patent applicants acro ss all technology \nsectors without a recognized mechanism to be compensated for unreasonable patent office examination \ndelays. Even worse for pharmaceutical and other health -sector innovators, the Supreme Court  held that \nthe decision should be applied retroactively to their patents – eliminating overnight thousands of patents. \nUnder the WTO Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Brazil is \nrequired to make the enjoyment of pat ent rights available without discrimination as to the field of  \n \n 20 \ntechnology and prevent the unreasonable curtailment of patent rights. As evidenced by the discriminatory \ndecision to apply the Supreme Court decision nullifying health -sector patents retroactively, \npharmaceutical innovators are not enjoying these protectio ns in Brazil.  Countries have long recognized \nthat patent office delays diminish the incentive that patents are designed to provide and stunt critical \ninvestment to small and medium enterprises. The failure to provide patent term adjustment (P TA) for all \nfields of technology is out of step with international intellectual property standards and presents a \nsignificant regulatory barrier to trade and investment. Without the protection that PTA mechanisms \nprovide, companies will be reluctant to make the investme nts that lead to innovation.   \n \nPrivacy Law  \n \nIn 2018, Brazil passed a privacy law, Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD).  It is closely modeled after the \nEU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and has extraterritorial scope.  However, the LGPD lacks \nseveral  provisions in the GDPR designed to lessen the burden on smaller firms.19 Further, the LGPD does not \npermit cross -border data transfers based on the controller’s legitimate interests, but rather lists ten instances in \nwhich cross -border data transfer under the LGPD is permitted.20 In addition, the national authority is tasked with \ndetermining whether a foreign government or international organization has a sufficient data protection scheme \nin place before any data is authorized to be transferred to the government or organization.21  \n \nUSCIB commends the National Data Protection Authority (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados - ANPD) \non consulting with stakeholders on the regulation of international data transfers under the LGPD and recommends \nthat the ANPD recognizes that existing c ontractual transfer mechanisms already used by companies to transfer \ndata cross borders may satisfy the LGPD’s obligations.  \n \nThe Brazilian Congress introduced Bill of Law N° 4097, DE 2023 , which would introduce new “digital \nsovereignty” measures into the General Data Protection Law. It appears to require IT companies providing \nservices in Brazil to have a substantial percentage of Brazilian ownership and control (e.g., 25% of the voting \nshare capital held by Brazilian nationals, be incorporated under Brazilian law or headquartered in Brazil).  \n \nTaxation  \n \nResolution GECEX n. 173 (2021) reduced by 10  percent  the import duty on several capital goods and ICT \nproducts, such as smartphones, notebooks, and their components. We encourage the government to continue its \npolicy of a gradual reduction of the tariffs, especially for ICT goods, with a transparent and predict able timeline \nfor each reduction, to put the country at the same level of competitiveness as other OECD countries, boost Brazil’s \ncompetitiveness, and encourage innovation.  \n \nNon-Tariff Barriers  \n \nRegulation on Conformity Assessment and Approval of Telecommunications Products (Resolution No. 715, of  \n2019) prohibits the use and marketing in Brazil of non -approved telecommunications products. Published in 2020, \nAct n. 4521 (2020) required all certificated telecom products be homologated prior to importation, except for lab \n \n19 Erin Locker \u0026 David Navetta, Brazil’s New Data Protection Law: The LGPD , COOLEY POLICY \u0026 LEGISLATION  (Sept. 18, 2018), \nhttps://cdp.cooley.com/brazils -new-data-protection -law-the-lgpd.  \n20 Chris Brook, Breaking Down LGPD, Brazil’s New Data Protection Law , DATA INSIDER  (June 10, 2019), \nhttps://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/breaking -down -lgpd-brazils -new-data-protection -law (noting that the instances where cross -border data \ntransfer is allowable are found in articles 33 -36 of the LGPD).  \n21 Brazil’s New Data Protection Law: The LGPD , supra  note 78.   \n \n 21 \ntesting. Samples for other local tests and prototypes are under specific authorizations (for Temporary Use of \nSpectrum or for Special Service for Scientific and Experimental Purposes). These processes are not clear and the \naverage time to grant approval is  estimated to be from 60 to 90 days. USTR should encourage the improvement \nof such regulations to require on ly minimal information to ensure the level of confidentiality needed, especially \nfor prototypes. In addition, to facilitate the import of products a nd investment in Brazil, the import process should \nallow entry of reasonable quantities and should be  compatible with global company operations.  \n \nAdditionally, Brazil is one of the few countries in the Western Hemisphere that does not allow importation of \nremanufactured goods. USTR should encourage Brazil to allow for the import of remanufactured goods and parts, \nwhich can reduce the consumer cost a nd company service costs of such goods while helping advance \nenvironmental goals by facilitating a more circular economy.  \n \nBrazil applies federal and state taxes and charges to imports, thereby effectively doubling the cost of imported \nproducts in Brazil and posing challenges especially for US chemical and plastic exporters. As part of the accession \nprocess, Brazil should acce de to the WTO Chemical Tariff Harmonization Agreement (CTHA).  \n \nNew Ex -Tariff Special Regime Requirement  \n \nBrazil’s customs regime allows for \"ex -tariff\" imports of foreign and US  manufactured goods under some \ncircumstances. When there is no similar equipment being manufactured locally, an importer can seek import duty \nwaivers to reduce import costs. This reduction is called \"ex -tariff\" (\"ex tarifário\"). The ex -tariff regulation con sists \nof a temporary reduction on import duties of capital goods and information technology and telecommunications \nproducts when  there is no domestic equivalent production.  \n \nIn August 2023, the Brazilian Government published a new resolution for “Ex -Tariff” concessions, adding \nrequirements to the process for renewal /concession of the regime. For a renewal or future “Ex -tariff” request, \nimporters should present an investment p roject in addition to the proof of no domestic production of similar/like \nproducts. In summary, the investment project needs to justify the creation of the tariff exception by presenting the \nstrategic relevance of the equipment to the development of the in ternal market. The project should include the \nfunction of the equipment in each  production line; the schedule and location of use; the essentiality or productivity \ngains from the use of the new equipment; the innovative technologies the product presents or improvements in \nthe final product, plus any other information that justifies t he duty exemption. This is part of this Administration´s \nstrategy to attract more investments and strengthen the local/national industry.  \n \nThe Ex -Tariff regime consists of the temporary reduction through 2028 of the tax rates for the import of capital \ngoods (BK), information technology and telecommunications (BIT), as shown in the Common External Tariff \nof Mercosur (TEC), when there is no nat ional production equivalent. The Ex -tariff regime promotes the \nattraction of investments in the country, since it exempts investments directed to productive enterprises. In order \nfor this regime to attract even more investments, it is critical that Brazili an government ensures Mercosur’s \napproval to extend the Ex -Tariff regime. Otherwise, all products that benefit from this regime, including \ncutting -edge technology for the Brazilian consumers, will resume its original imports tariff. The Brazilian \nimports t ariff for ICT products, for example, is the one of the highest in the world.  \n \nBrazil should take steps to reduce its tariff and non -tariff barriers to trade. Brazil imposes relatively high tariffs \non a wide range of products, including chemicals and plastics. As part of the accession process, Brazil should \naccede to the WTO Chemical  Tariff Harmonization Agreement (CTHA).  \n \n   \n \n 22 \nE-Labeling  \n \nThe e -labeling option introduced by ANATEL applies only to devices with built -in electronic screens or with a \ntethered screen and QR Code.  We recommend USTR push  for this flexibility to be extended to other devices, \nsuch as chargers and adaptors, for which information can be provided in User Guides and/or links to the \ncompany’s website, instead of on the physical product.  \n \nSeveral proposals are currently being considered in Brazil that would move in the oppositive direction, however, \nby requiring physical labels, for example on different aspects of use such as “excessive” usage and to control \nchildren's’ use, in addition to the other regulatory labels and markings required by law. For innovative ICT \nproducts with ever -shrinking packaging, such requirements will be increasingly difficult to implement.  Such \nrequirements can have the opposite effect of their intended policy obje ctive, resulting in consumers/users \nbecoming confused by clusters of labels, marks, and markings. Such labeling also is likely to increase costs for \ntracking the correct labels, marks, and markings for products and updating labels over time (e.g., revising  label \nartwork, scrapping old inventory, etc.).  \n \nCAMBODIA  \n \nNational Internet Gateway  \n \nReports of censorship and mandated Internet filtering and blocking continue to rise in Cambodia.  A sub -decree \nsigned in 2021 established the National Internet Gateway, creating a single point of entry for internet traffic \nregulated by a government -appoint ed operator. This could be abused and misused to block online content and \nkeep out certain foreign digital services, akin to China’s “Great Firewall.”  \n \nDraft Cybercrime Bill  \n \nThe Cambodian Interior Ministry has developed a draft Cybercrime bill22 which includes provisions that could \nmake intermediary platforms liable for content uploaded by third parties,  require platforms to retain and provide \naccess to user data, and keep confidential all government requests to produce such data . It also includes broad \nprovisions that mandate data localization to facilitate access by government authorities.  If adopted, the bill would \ncontravene data minimization principles and could be used to as a mechanism for government censorship or \ntargeting of individuals.   \n \nDraft Personal Data Protection Law  \n \nThe Personal Data Protection Law (drafted by Ministry of Post and Telecommunications) restricts transfer of \npersonal data outside of Cambodia in Article 22 which is not only rare for privacy laws to include but will inhibit \nthe growth of cross border business es that involve personal data (i.e. e -commerce, remittances) in Cambodia.  \n \n  \n \n22https://www.voanews.com/a/east -asia-pacific_activists -cambodias -draft -cybercrime -law-imperils -free-expression -privacy/6196959.html   \n \n 23 \nCANADA  \n \nTelecommunications  \n \nUSTR should continue to encourage t he Government of Canada to successfully resolve competitive issues in \nCanadian telecommunications. Complete removal of Canada’s foreign investment restriction s for (non-sovereign ) \ninvestors and operators in both telecommunications and broadcasting would greatly increase market entry and \ninvestment in Canada, open broad access for Canadian carriers t o international capital markets and encourage \ngreater facilities -based competition in the Canadian telecommunications industry . \n \nWe ask USTR to use every opportunity to urge the Government of Canada to prioritize the complete removal of \nforeign ownership restrictions as a more certain and direct means to a more competitive and innovative market \nfor Canadians and increased capital in vestment. Policies aimed at increasing the number of players through \nsubsidies and mandated access may compare unfavorably with the simpler policy of opening up the market \ncompletely to direct  foreign investment.  \n \nWe also urge Canada to regulate in a manner to maximize a light touch approach.  For example, Canada should \nnot apply more burdensome licensing requirements on a company providing more than one regulated service \nwhere a less burdensome option is available for each of the services individually.  Canada currently imposes \nCompetitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) obligations on resellers of VoIP services even if they also own \ntelecom infrastructure that is not used in the provision of VoIP.  Ideally, the reseller  would be able to file a simple \nregistration as a non -dominant facilities -based  carrier for the network assets, but not be bound by those obligations \nfor the VoIP services it resells.  \n \nDigital Services Tax \n \nCanada has implemented or is considering a wide range of harmful digital policies targeting US firms. In July, \nCanada implemented a unilateral digital services tax (DST) that disproportionately targets US companies and \ncontravenes its trade commitments, including under the US-Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA). The DST \ntook the form of a 3% tax on revenue from certain digital services provided by bus inesses with gross revenues of \nat least €750 million and in -scope Canadian revenues of at least $20 million (CAD). Implementing legislation – \nthe Digital Services Tax Act  - retroactively imposes the DST to 2022. This unprecedented measure is not only \ncontr ary to international taxation norms  but will have a chilling effect on Canada’s investment climate. The \nretroactive aspect of the proposed DST can be seen as state expropriation of foreign private resources and signals \na dangerous precedent within Canada, while also giving tacit permission to other nations to engage in this type of \naction Canada is violating longstanding international tax norms and harming global efforts at the OECD to achieve \na consensus -based solution for international tax harmonization.  \n \nC-11 - Online Streaming Act  \n \nOn June 4, 2024, the Canadian Radio -television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC, Commission) \nissued its first major decision following the passage of the Online Streaming Act in 2023. The Commission’s \ndecision stipulates that foreign, largely US-based, streaming service providers with revenues over $25M would \nbe required to contribute 5% of their gross in -country revenue to a set of Canadian cultural funds. Despite US \nstreamers making substantial investments in producing content in Canada, this finan cial levy is scoped to target \nthese US companies and includes discriminatory qualifying factors that largely prevent them from accessing the \nfunds to which the levy flows. The Canadian government, including through the Minister of Heritage’s formal \npolicy direction to the Chair of the CRTC, ha s repeatedly stated that C -11’s implementation by the Commission  \n \n 24 \nshould value the substantial contributions US streamers already make to the Canadian broadcast system and allow \nfor flexibility in how they meet the Commission’s regulatory requirements. However, the recent decision indicates \nthat the CRTC is in fact unfairly targeting US companies and at risk of further disregarding the investments these \ncompanies make to produce content in Canada as C -11 implementation moves forward. Over the next two years, \nthe CRTC will carry out a series of consultations, including to redefine Canadian content and settle on final \ncontribution requirements that may go beyond the already onerous 5% revenue requirement and may include local \ncontent production and discoverability requirements.  \n \nPrivacy  \n \nBill C -27, which includes comprehensive federal privacy legislation, is currently being studied by the House of \nCommons Industry Committee. The bill aims to update Canada’s current privacy law for the private sector, \nbringing it in closer alignment with Eu ropean data protection and privacy standards, and introduces new privacy \nprotections for minors. While the government has stated a desire to prioritize interoperability with new \nregulations, there is still work to be done at the committee level to ensure c onsistency and predictability for \nbusinesses operating across Canada. This includes introducing a consistent definition of a minor (which currently \nvaries across provinces), adding clarity on consent exceptions, including the addition of advertising and ma rketing \nas a legitimate business activity, and confirming a 2 -3-year implementation process. Once approved by the House \nof Commons Committee, the bill will be studied in the Senate.  \n \nArtificial Intelligence  \n \nIn June 2022, the Government of Canada tabled the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) as part of Bill C -\n27, the Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022.  AIDA proposes significant new powers for the government to \nregulate ‘high -impact’ AI systems  but includes overly broad definitions of ‘high -impact’ systems that may capture \nlow-risk use cases and poses significant risks to US companies and the US-led risk -based approach to AI \ngovernance. The proposal also includes monetary penalties of up to 3% of global revenues and introduced a first \nof its kind criminal enforcement provision for non -compliance. This regulatory approach will create a massive \ncompliance burden on leading US AI researchers and developers and threaten interoperability across North \nAmerica. AIDA has attracted controversy since its introduction, with criticism from stakeholders over its vague \ndrafting, lack of proper consultation, and misalignment with global standards.   \n \nMedia  \n \nCanada maintains one of the most restrictive media markets in the developed world – limiting foreign investment \nin a wide variety of media sectors and imposing quotas as well.  The result is that US participation in the Canadian \nTV market is largely limited to licensing content to Canadian entities.  Recognizing that cultural carve -outs are \nantiquated measures that do little if nothing to foster cultural diversity, USTR should develop policies to ensure \nthat cultural carve -outs do not become a barrier to inve stment and ensure that harmful cultural provisions such as \nthose imposed by Canada under the USMCA do not contaminate future Free Trade Agreement negotiations.   \n \nData Localization  \n \nPursuant to Income Tax Information Circulars IC78 -10R5 and IC05 -1R1, books and records that are required to \nbe maintained under the Income Tax Act must be kept at the person's place of business in Canada (unless otherwise \napproved by the Minister) and must , upon request, be made available to officers of the Canada Revenue Agency \n(CRA) for audit purposes. Records kept outside Canada and accessed electronically from Canada are not \nconsidered to be records in Canada. We urge CRA to clarify that the obligation to keep records in a server in  \n \n 25 \nCanada should be automatically exempted where records stored abroad are made available in Canada in an \nelectronically readable and useable format for CRA officials and contain adequate details to support the tax returns \nfiled with the CRA.  \n \nThe Province of Quebec adopted privacy legislation  in 2021  that only permit s public and private sector entities \n(with limited exceptions) to transmit personal data outside of the province to jurisdictions with a level of \nprotection equivalent to Quebec’s privacy law. Amendments to the Bill include d changing the “equivalency” \nrequirement, as it related to cross border data transfers, and an “adequacy” requirement . Other provinces are also \nadopting privacy frameworks.  \n \nThere is a concern that restrictions on data transfers, especially if introduced at provincial level before a new \ncommon federal position is enacted, could create excessive compliance costs for businesses operating in Canada \nand risks to data security.  \n \nDe Minimis  \n \nCanada’s de minimis  threshold (the level below which no duty or tax is charged on imported items) remains at \nCAD $20 (approximately USD $15), the lowest of any industrialized country and among the lowest in the entire \nworld.  For comparison, the de minimis  threshold for items imported into the United States is $800 USD  – over 40 \ntimes higher than Canada’s. This low threshold, which has not been adjusted since the 1980s, creates an \nunnecessary barrier to trade through increased transaction costs for Canadian businesses, and acts to restrict \nconsumer choice and competition.  Raising the de minimis  would help Canadian small businesses participate more \nfully in global trade and e -commerce, growing Canada’s digital economy. Recent studies have also shown that \nany gains realized by collecting additional duties are often outweighed by the cost of assessing and processing the \nhigh volume of shipments that fall below the low threshold.  In fact, proposals to increase the de minimis  threshold \nhave been shown to be revenue  neutral or even positive for the Canadian Government.   \n \nCanada C -18 \n \nIn 2023 , Canada enacted the “Online News Act ,” establish ing a framework through which digital news \nintermediary operators and news businesses  must  enter into agreements regarding news content that is made \navailable by digital news intermediaries, including links and short extracts. The Canadian Radio -television an d \nTelecommunications Commission (CRTC) would administer key elements such as whether a platform meets the \ncriteria and to help oversee  mandatory  negotiations. The legislation is inconsistent with Canada’s commitments \nunder the USMCA, including but not limited to the targeting of only US-headquartered companies and employing \nperformance requirements (Article 14.10),  and commitments under the Berne Convention. The nature of the \nmandatory arbitration mechanism also raises concerns about due process and transparency.  \n \nC-11 - Online Streaming Act  \n \nIn April 2023, the Government passed Bill C -11 Act to amend the Broadcasting Act, aimed at extending CRTC \nregulatory authority over online services and imposing various parameters for regulation aimed at requiring “web \ngiants” to contribute to the creation , production, and distribution of Canadian content in English and in French. \nWhile regulations prescribing investment and discoverability requirements are yet to be finalized, the Act gives \nsignificant power to an unelected regulator (Canadian Radio -televi sion and Telecommunications Commission – \nCRTC) to collect information, set ridged investment quotas, and impose fines.  Already the CRTC has released \nearly decisions that scope in a wide set of streaming services with revenue over $10M CAD, including podca st \nnetworks, most of which are US-based. US streaming services already invest billions of dollars annually into  \n \n 26 \nCanada’s creative sector, but there are no requirements in the Act for the CRTC to recognize these investments \nwhen setting mandatory contribution requirements. Resulting regulations could disincentivize existing \ninvestments, and negatively impact customer  choice, affordability, and the ability for companies to innovate on \nbehalf of their Canadian customers.  \n \nPrivacy  \n \nBill C -27, federal privacy legislation, aims to update Canada’s current privacy law for the private sector, bringing \nit in closer alignment with European data protection and privacy standards, and introduces new privacy protections \nfor minors. While the go vernment has stated a desire to prioritize interoperability with new regulations, there is \nstill work to be done to ensure consistency and predictability for businesses operating across Canada. This \nincludes introducing a consistent definition of a minor ( which currently varies across provinces), adding clarity \non consent exceptions, and confirming a 2 -3-year implementation process.  \n \nPharmaceuticals  \n \nThere are several concerning developments that undermine the effective value of IP -intensive industries.  Canada \noffer s insufficient protection for business confidential information and regulatory data impacting various sectors, \nincluding test data for health products and chemical concentrations. This has a  directly negative impact on US \ninnovation and exports, while also further undermining innovation and investment in Canada.  \n \nOther Canadian IP issues impacting US companies include continued challenges protecting and enforcing \ncopyrights in Canada, issues with expanded plans to advance plain packaging requirements that infringe on core \ntrademark rights, and ongoing implementatio n of Canada -EU Trade Agreement23 provisions on geographical \nindications that undermine the ability of the United States  and other countries to protect existing trademarks and \nenjoy fair treatment for those making products on terms already treated as generic.  \n \nCustoms Valuation  \n \nOn May 29, 2023, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) announced proposed changes to the Valuation \nfor duty Regulations, published in the Canada Gazette May 27, 2023 , and or iginally provided interested \nstakeholders until June 26, 2023, for comment.  A 30 -day extension was granted for comments with a final due \ndate of July 26, 2023.  \n \nThe proposed regulatory amendments by the CBSA to the Valuation for Duty Regulations seek to clarify which \nsale is to be used to calculate the duty on imported goods by (i) defining the term “sold for export to Canada”; \nand (ii) amending the definition of the term “purchaser in Canada”, in the interest of addressing a perceived \nregulatory gap that, in the view of CBSA, unfairly benefits non -resident importers relative to Canadian resident \nimporters. Unfortunately, the proposed regulatory amendments, rather than clarifying, would introduce \nconsiderable legal ambiguity and unpredictability to how duties are to be calculated. As a result, the proposed \namendments would have numerous unintended consequences, including increased duties for Canadian resident \nimport ers, putting Canada at odds with its international obligations, and exacerbating already challenging \ninflationary pressures on Canadian consumers. For the reasons shared in our joint submission with the Canadian \nChamber of Commerce (CCC) we urge CBSA to wi thdraw this proposal.   \n \n \n23 Government of Canada, Canada -European Union Trade Agreement Final Text .  \n \n 27 \nThe CBSA has issued an update as follows ,24 “CBSA response: As indicated in the  consultation notice  published \non the CBSA's website on  September 28, 2023, the policy objective is not to use a price in a sale between a \nCanadian resident importer and its Canadian customer as the basis for determining the value for duty. The CBSA \ndoes not anticipate the ad ministration of these regulatory amendments to change anything for Canadian resident \nimporters who are currently declaring their purchase price from their foreign supplier.  Non-resident  importers \nwho currently declare their purchase price from their foreig n supplier, as opposed to their sale price to a buyer \nlocated in Canada, will incur higher duty costs resulting from the regulatory amendments. However, this is \nnecessary to level the playing field for all importers and achieve the objectives of the propos ed \nregulatory  amendments.  \n \nCBSA subject matter experts are working diligently with the Department of Justice to ensure the intent expressed \nin the  Canada  Gazette  Part I is achieved, including consideration of all comments received. The CBSA \nunderstands the importance of clearly defi ning the terms \"sold for export to Canada\" and \"purchaser in Canada\" \nand appreciates the feedback provided in this  regard.  \n \nCBSA  would like to thank all of the individuals that participated in the formal and informal consultative processes \nthat have taken place as part of the regulatory development process, and values all of the feedback received. \nAmendments to the proposal are bei ng considered to address stakeholder feedback and ensure clarity of the \nregulatory  language.  \n \nFollowing implementation, the CBSA will be providing further clarification of the regulatory amendments \nthrough policy updates. These policy updates will be made publicly  available on the CBSA's  website.”25 \n \nTo date, no additional updates have been provided to interested stakeholders.  The USG should continue to engage \nin this matter at bilateral levels.   \n \nCHILE  \n \nData Localization  \n \nThe Chilean financial regulator (CMF) has rules related to the general IT outsourcing of services (RAN 20 -7) that \nallow cloud adoption in country and abroad  but require financial institutions to have local data centers for \ncontingency purposes, when processing relevant data / critical workloads abroad. The 2017 version of the \nregulation issued by the CMF did not allow for an exception to requirements on local  infrastructure for \ncontingency purposes. Following a public consultation process in 2019, the CMF agreed to create an exception \nfor the aforementioned requirement. However, the regulator authorized a narrow exception exclusively for banks \nthat maintain ad equate operational risk management per CMF’s assessment. Many financial institutions in Chile \ncannot benefit from the exception, as they do not meet CMF’s requirements on “adequate” operational risk \nmanagement. This has become a blocker for the advance of data hosting services in Chile, as it effectively funnels \nfinancial institutions to local infrastructure offerings. During June 2023, the CMF committed the review of RAN \n20-7 as part of 2023 priorities  but has not been able to deliver.  \n \n  \n \n24 What we heard report: Proposed regulatory amendments to the Valuation for Duty Regulations (cbsa -asfc.gc.ca)  \n25 What we heard report: Proposed regulatory amendments to the Valuation for Duty Regulations (cbsa -asfc.gc.ca) . Updated May 8, \n2024. Accessed September 30, 2024.    \n \n 28 \nDigital Payments  \n \nIn June 2024, the Supreme Court issued its opinion following a broad market review of Chile’s digital payments \nlandscape, including a finding that requires payment networks to agree with clients on future rule changes. On \nAugust 30, 2024, the Court affirme d a ruling that the National Economic Prosecutor will be the decider in the \nevent of a rule dispute.  \n \nCell Phone Labeling and Emergency Warning Alerts  \n \nIn 2017 , Undersecretariat of Telecommunications  issued “Manual of Graphic Standards: Broadband Label” \nrequiring  all mobile phone vendors  to include a label on their packaging and advertising indicating that device’s \ncompatibility with all mobile networks. The label requirement is unduly broad and costly. It is required on all \nphones, even those that operate in all b rands. It thus is not justified by providing additional information to \nconsumers who, without such a label, would correctly assume that the phone would  work in whatever b rand the \nconsumer uses.  \n \nThe guidelines further define the exact specifications of the label – design, colors, size, and placement. The \nspecifications apply to the mobile phone’s physical packaging, in -store promotional and displays, TV \nadvertisements, and internet advertising and  sales. They thus impose country -specific obligations for products \nmarketed and sold in Chile. The requirements, so far, do not appear to extend to print advertising.  \n \nThese labeling requirements were not previously notified to the impacted industries. Article 7.7 of the United \nStates -Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Technical Barriers to Trade states that “each Party shall allow \nPersons of the other party to particip ate in the development of standards, technical regulations and conformity \nassessment procedures.” The FTA requires parties to “provide information regarding the objective of, and \nrationale for a standard, technical regulation, or conformity assessment proc edure that the Party has adopted or is \nproposing to adopt.” Articles 2 and 10 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), establish \nnorms for transparency related to a government’s preparation and adoption of technical regulations.  \n \nChile already requires unique labels for mobile phones , the emergency system , and food label  and continues to \ndiscuss others. Rather than providing information, a proliferation of labels, marks, and markings are likely to \ncreate confusion, increase costs, and increase the regulatory burden for companies. Particularly problematic are \nthose additional requirements for certain goods, such as ICT devices, where packaging is decreasing in size. USTR \nshould encourage careful analysis of the real and cumulative im pact of labels before Chile requires them. When \nsuch a label is determined to be needed, options such as e -labels and website communications should be preferred \nto provide consumer information without unnecessary barriers to market entry for goods.  \n \nPower Adapter Marking  \n \nUSTR should encourage the Chilean Government to adopt  international standards, without adding Chile -specific \nrequirements, and to eliminate the requirement of factory inspections just for the Chilean market and instead \naccept existing international documentation issued by international bodies -CB scheme such as TUV (USA), UL \n(EU.) \n \n   \n \n 29 \nNutrition Labeling  \n \nIn 2019 , the final stage of implementation of the “Nutritional Composition of Foodstuff and their Advertisement” \nentered in to force.  The main aspects of this stage were : (1) Definition of the maximum thresholds of nutrient \nconcentrations, and (2) Application of the obligation to label the descriptor “ high in” transversally. The Decree \nestablishes limits for calories, added sugar, sodium , and saturated fat, above which processed food and beverages \nmust include front -of-package octagonal, black,  and white labels (resembling stop signs) warning that the product \nis “high in” these nutrients, and further subjects labeled products to marketing and advertising restrictions, and \nprohibitions on the use of images deemed appealing to children under 14 ye ars of age, including possibly \ntrademarked characters.   \n \nThe United States, other WTO m embers, and other stakeholders  have repeatedly raised concerns with the \nprovisions of Decree No. 13 in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT).  Chile has not \nmeaningfully addressed these concerns or presented scientific justification for the regulation’s departure from \ninternational standards.  \n \nThe regulation’s nutrient limits are not based on available international standards nor has Chile made available \nthe methodology or risk assessment by which the limits were developed.  Further, restrictions on marketing , \nadvertising and prohibitions on the use images violate intellectual property rights are inconsistent with Chile’s \ninternational agreement.  The regulation grants MINSAL unacceptably broad discretion to undermine the \nintellectual property rights of well -recognized brand identities and register ed trademarks.  \n \nIn contrast to Chile’s international trade obligations under the WTO Agreements and in other international \ninvestment agreements, the amended provisions are not based on science or internationally -recognized standards \n(such as those established by the Gene ral Guidelines of Codex Alimentarius) and appear to be more trade \nrestrictive than necessary to meet Chile’s legitimate objective of reducing obesity and non -communicable \ndiseases, thus compromising Chile’s obligations under the TBT Agreement.  Moreover, th e marketing and \nadvertising restrictions may contradict Chile’s obligations under the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of \nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).  \n \nLikewise, the regulation appears to violate Chile’s commitments under the investment chapter of the US-Chile \nFree Trade Agreement, including guarantees relating to the minimum standard of treatment, national treatment, \nand non -expropriation.   \n \nIntellectual Property  \n \nIndustry is also concerned about the  erosion of Chile’s intellectual property policy framework  and pressures  to \nissue compulsory licenses (CLs) for certain innovative medicines. These developments add to longstanding \nintellectual property (IP) problems, including Chile’s failure to fully implement its patent enforcement and \nregulatory data protection (RDP) obliga tions under the US-Chile Free Trade Agreement.  \n \nFinally, Chile continues to be in non -compliance with a number of its intellectual property obligations in the US-\nChile FTA.  \n \n   \n \n 30 \nExpress Shipment Delivery  \n \nUnder the US-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Chile committed to expedited customs procedures for express \nshipments and to allow a shipper “to submit a single manifest covering all goods contained in a shipment \ntransported by the express shipment service, through, if possible, electronic means”26. However, the current \ncustoms systems cannot process all the data from different carriers, causing delays at the border.   \n \nAdditionally, under the FTA, Chile agreed to “ their desire to maintain the level of open market access existing on \nthe date this Agreement is signed .”27 The Chilean government had in place a trade facilitation mechanism for \nshipments under USD $41, excluding those shipments from VAT and customs duties. However, on September \n25, 2024, Chile passed a bill that eliminates the VAT exemption on shipments under  USD $41, reducing the prior \nopen market access policies for express delivery shipments, contrary to the FTA.   \n \nCHINA  \n \nUSCIB and its members understand and appreciate that U S-China economic relations are complex and \nmultifaceted, and that American business holds a direct and important stake in this relationship and in its success. \nAs the world’s largest economy , China’s practices and policies have a significant impact on its trading partners, \nand engagement with China can be tumultuous and challenging. China’s growing importance in the global \neconomy provides strong incentives for both countries to work together as partners to address our common \nchallenges and responsibilities.  \n \nOn September 6, 2024 , USCIB separately submitted extensive comments on China’s Compliance with Its WTO \nCommitments to USTR (in response to Docket Number USTR –2024 –0012 ). The China WTO compliance \nsubmission in addition to the below, provide the full picture of USCIB concerns with respect to China ’s barriers \nto trade.  See USCIB’s  2024 China WTO Compliance Report  linked  here.  \n \nMarket Access for Cloud Services  \n \nChina implements a licensing system for telecommunications business operations. Only companies established in \nChina, after obtaining a telecom business license, can engage in telecom business activities. Foreign companies’ \nparticipation in value added tele communication (VAT) sector is highly restrictive. Based on Telecommunications \nRegulations of the People's Republic of China , Classification Catalogue of Telecommunications Services , and \nSpecial Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access (Negativ e List) (2021 Version), foreign \ncompanies are still denied access to the business sectors critical to cloud services, namely B11 Internet data center \n(IDC) business, and B12 content distribution network (CDN) service.  \n \nDigital Trade Barriers/ Data Localization and Cross -border Data Flow  \n \nChina imposes complex restrictions on the storage, movement, and access to data across borders, making it very \ndifficult and costly for foreign companies to manage their global operations. In 2021, China released Personal \nInformation Protection Law  (PIPL) and Data Security Law  (DSL), which, along with the Cybersecurity Law  \n(CSL) implemented in 2017, established an overarching regulatory framework on data. The framework sets out \nthree pathways for the cross -border data flow, namely security assessments, prot ection certification and standard \ncontracts.  \n \n26 Article 5.7. express shipments.  \n27 Annex 11.6 on express delivery shipments.   \n \n 31 \n \nOn security assessment, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)’s Measures on Data Exit Security \nAssessment , effective since September 1, 2022, stipulate the requirements for cross -border transfer of important \ndata and personal information by Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators and other companies that \nreach certain thresholds of data. The Measu res put forward specific requirements for data exit security assessment, \nstipulating that data processors shall conduct a data exit risk self -evaluation before applying for data exit security \nassessment. Alongside the Measures, the regulations and standards on protection certification and standard \ncontracts of personal data cross -border flow were also promulgated, forming a cross -border personal d ata flow \nmanagement mechanism.  \n \nNoting that the existing data transfer framework is impeding economic growth and impractical for domestic and \nforeign businesses operating in the global economy, on March 22, 2024, CAC promulgated new provisions on \npromoting and regulating and cross -border  data flows, which would limit instances in which the aforementioned \ncross -border personal data flow mechanism would apply or a data exit security assessment would be necessary.   \nIn particular, the new provisions allow that personal data transfers due to human resource management and \ncontractual transactions, such as cross -border e -commerce, cross -border payments, plane ticket purchases and \nhotel bookings, and visa applications be exempted under the cross -border personal data flow management \nmechanism.  Wh ile the new provisions do not further elaborate on the scope of “important data”, they stipulate \nthat data processors are not required to apply for a data exit security assessment if they have not been notified by \nthe relevant authorities, or if the data h as not been publicly declared as important data. Pilot Free Trade Zones \nwithin Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Hainan may also develop their own negative list of data for which the cross -\nborder personal data flow mechanism would not apply.  Beijing, Tianjin  and Shanghai authorities have started to \npublish such negative lists.  \n \nCybersecurity  \n \n• Critical Information Infrastructure. The CII Security Protection Regulation , effective from September 1, \n2021, requires reinforced protection of CII. This regulation promotes the procurement of “secure and \ntrustworthy” network products and services, which would result in unequal treatment between Chinese \nand foreign companies’ pr oducts. If a company is identified as a CII, other obligations under Chinese \nsecurity legislation, such as mandatory certification and assessment, and cybersecurity review have to be \nimposed, which creates compliance cost and potential entry barrier to cer tain sectors. Over the past 2 years, \nregulations and standards relating to CII have been rolled out steadily by relevant authorities. In May \n2023, China’s first national standard for CII security protection GB/T 39204 -2022 Information security \ntechnology – Cybersecurity Requirements for CII Protection  became effective. The Administrative \nMeasures for the Security Protection of CII for Highways and Waterways  promulgated by the Ministry of \nTransport also became effective on June 1, 2023.  \n• Cybersecurity Review. The Cybersecurity Review Measures (CSRM)  were revised on January 4, 2022, \nmaking it mandatory for CII operators procuring network products and services, and online platform \noperators conducting data handling activities that influence or may influence national security, to \nproactively apply for a  cybersecurity review. The review is an opaque process, presumably assessing a \nhost of factors, including the security, openness, transparency, and diversity of sources of products and \nservices; the reliability of supply channels, as well as the risk of su pply disruptions due to political, \ndiplomatic, and trade factors. For example, CAC launched and failed a cybersecurity review of Micron in \nearly 2023, resulting in a demand for CII operators to stop purchasing its products. With vague criteria \nand broad sc ope, China’s cybersecurity review regime could be abused and used to discriminate against \nforeign technology providers, thus creating entry barrier for many MNCs.  \n   \n \n 32 \nSecure and Controllable ICT Policies.   \n \nThe Chinese government has implemented secure and controllable ICT policies through various laws and \nregulations, including the Cybersecurity Review, the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Measures , \nand the Cryptography Law . These policies have been reinforced under the banner of technological self -reliance \nand security since 14th Five Year Plan  in 2021. In practice, these policies have been widely used, creating \nobstacles for foreign ICT products to get into sectors ranging from government, CII  operators, and even State -\nOwned Enterprises (SOE). In past years, the concept of SOE Cloud and State Cloud in China has further \nexemplified the policy.  \n \nCryptography Law.   \n \nChina’s Cryptography Law,  enacted on October 26, 2019, and effective starting January 1, 2020, classifies \nencryption into three categories: “core,” “common,” and “commercial” encryption. “Core” and “common” \nencryption categories are used to protect information considered to be “st ate secrets,” while commercial \nencryption is used to protect information that is not a state secret. In April 2023, Commercial Cryptography \nAdministrative Regulations  was amended. The amended regulations fail to support the interop erability of inter -\nnational standards and use of internationally standardized encryption algorithms, suggest an extensive import \nlicense/export control scheme, include ambiguous clauses that potentially enforce a de facto mandatary \ncertification instead of  a voluntary one, and impose requirements applicable only to CII and party and government \norgans to networks above MLPS level three. Furthermore, on October 7, 2023, the State Cryptography \nAdministration (SCA) published the Administrative Measures for Secu rity Assessment of Commercial \nCryptography Applications (Measures) , which came into effect on November 1, 2023. The Measures proposed \nthe concept of Important Network and Information Systems without providing definitions. If the above issues are \nnot clarified, the regulations will impose high compliance cost and create e ntry barrier for MNCs who heavily \nrely on encryption algorithms that comport with international standards.  \n \nMarket Access  for ICT Industry  \n \nChina continues to restrict its telecommunications market for both Basic - and Value - added services.  China \ncontinues to restrict market access through its  licensing requirements , high capitalization requirements, and \nthrough the continuing absence of an independent regulator.  \n \nChina should amend its joint venture requirements and FDI limits for Value Added Services (VAS). These \nrequirements inhibit market access, competition, and innovation. Moreover, in its classif ication  of service s, China \ncreated an intentionally restrictive distinction between international and domestic services. For example, China \ndefines International Virtual Private Line service as a Basic Telecommunications Service, while the exact same \nVPN service provided domestically is defined as Value Add ed. This dis tinction is material, because foreign \ncompanies are required to partner (49 percent joint venture) with a domestic telecommunications company (that \nholds a Basic License), as compared to VAS licenses where foreign companies can partner (50 percent joint \nventure) with any Chinese company irrespective of whether it holds a Basic Telecommunications license or not. \nIt is critical that MIIT interpret the definition of VAS in a manner that is consistent with China’s explicit WTO \ncommitment and widely accepted int ernational standards. Replacing these conservatively applied vertical service \nclassifications with more objective and transparent guidelines for Type I (facilities -based) and Type II (non -\nfacilities based) services would allow more foreign carriers to inve st in China . \n \nThe requirement that a foreign company select a state -owned and licensed telecom company as a joint -venture \npartner should be eliminated under the Basic Service license regime because the requirement is a significant  \n \n 33 \nmarket access barrier and incumbent licensees have only limited incentive to partner with foreign competitors.  \nChina limits foreign ownership to 49 percent and 50 percent respectively for a basic service license and VAS \nlicense.  These ownership limits place a significant market access barrier from an operational and economic \nperspective.  Service Providers are unable to establish operational control, protect their brand, and deliver services \nin China that are seamlessly integrated in the service provider’s g lobal network offerings.  Foreign entities thus \nestablished as Joint Ventures then become a horizontal competitor of their joint venture local operator, further \neroding the value of the foreign investment.  USTR should encourage China to remove this provision and allow \nforeign companies to partner with any legally operating telecom entity they find suitable.  \n \nThe Chinese government also imposes strict limitations on non -Chinese companies that wish to offer Voice over \nInternet Protocol (VoIP) services in China. No non -Chinese company may offer any kind of VoIP service in \nChina, as VoIP requires a VAS license, wh ich foreign companies may obtain only through a joint venture with a \nChinese company. Connection to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) requires a basic service license. \nOnly a few small pilot VoIP projects – involving the dominant Chinese telecom  operators  – are allowed to offer \nPSTN -interconnected VoIP services to Chinese consumers. USTR must urge the Chinese government to remove \nrestrictions in the efficient use of IP technologies, including voice applications.  \n \nExport Controls  \n \nChina’s export law of 202028 permits China to take reciprocal measures against “any country or region that abuses \nexport control measures to endanger the national security and interest of the People’s Republic of China.”  This \nlaw will be used to retaliate against US services as a result of ongoing US -China trade conflicts.  \n \nE-Commerce Law  \n \nThe broadly written China e-commerce  law (2019 )29 applies new regulations and requirements on all e -commerce \nactivities in China defined as the “sale of goods or services through the internet or any other information \nnetwork.”30 It requires  the need to obtain a business license to operate, plac ing a burden on small businesses.  \n \nNational Security Law  \n \nChina’s National Security Law contains several provisions that impose unnecessary cost on foreign competitors \nand explicitly promotes Chinese companies.   \n \n• Article 24, China proclaims that the intent of the National Security law is to promote Chinese industry – \n“strengthen indigenous innovation capabilities” . \n• Article 24:  State shall  strengthen indigenous innovation capabilities, accelerate development of  self-\ncontrollable  strategic high technology and essential core technology in critical fields; strengthen usage and \nprotection of IP;  protect science and t echnology state secrets to ensure the security of major technologies \nand projects ; and  \n  \n \n28 Available at http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zwgk/zcfb/202010/20201003008907.shtml.  \n29 Cyrus Lee, Law Regulating Online Shopping Activities Enforced in China , ZDN ET (Jan. 2, 2019), https://www.zdnet.com/article/law -regulating -\nonline -shopping -activities -enforced -in-china/.  \n30 A Game Changer? China Enacts First E -Commerce Law , HOGAN LOVELLS  (Sept. 21, 2018), \nhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f96bf736 -db32 -49fa-bec6 -2e0a813ae03c.   \n \n 34 \n• Article 59:  The State shall establish a national security review and oversight regime mechanism,  to carry \nout a national security review of foreign investment, special goods and critical technologies, network and \ninformation technology products and services, construct ion projects relating to national security, and other \nmajor items and activities that affect or potentially affect national security in order to effectively prevent \nand diminish national security risks . \n \nIndependent Regulator  for ICT Industry  \n \nChina also has not implemented its WTO Reference Paper commitment to establish an independent regulator.  \nThe Chinese government still owns and controls all major operators in the telecommunications industry, the MII T \nstill regulates the sector, and the State -owned Assets and Supervision Administration directly controls the three \nmajor operators. USCIB  encourages USTR to place a high priority on working with China to establish an \nindependent regulatory body that is separate from, and not accountable to, any basic telecoms supplier, and that \nis capable of issuing impartial telecom decisions and rules.  Specifically, it is important that the regulatory body \nadopt the following:  transparent procedures for drafting, finalizing, implementing , and applying regulations and \ndecisions; appropriate measures, consistent with the WTO Reference Paper to prevent dominant suppliers from \nengaging in, or continuing, anti -competitive practices.  USTR noted several of these concerns in the 2015 Section \n1377 review and USCIB encour ages USTR to continue to urge China to address these issues.  \n \nSince 1999, China has tried to promote network convergence between its telecom, internet , and broadcast \nnetworks without success. Conflicts between the broadcast and cable television regulator, State Administration \nof Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), and the telecom regulator, MIIT, have not been resolved despite guidance \nfrom the State Cou ncil under the Three -Network Convergence plan.  We encourage China to explore business \nmodels that merge resources between broadcasting and telecommunications and Inter net networks that create new \nmarkets and allow end -users to realize that network’s full potential. We recommend that China create a converged \nICT regulator merging the functions of SARFT and MIIT to eliminate and resolve the disruptiv e conflicts that \nhave occurred.  \n \nGovernment Procurement Restrictions  \n \nChina’s Government Procurement Law (GPL) stipulates that government procurement should purchase domestic \nproducts, services, and engineering projects, with exceptions made only when the targeted products are not \navailable in the Chinese market or are not u sed within China’s territory. It is noteworthy that in the draft for public \nopinion of the Implementing Regulations of Government Procurement Law in 2010, the term “domestic products” \nwas clearly defined as goods physically manufactured in Chinese territor y, with a certain proportion of domestic \nproduction costs, while “domestic services and engineering projects” were defined as being supplied by Chinese \nnationals, legal persons, or organizations. Nevertheless, these definitions were nowhere to be found in the formal \nImplementing Regulations of GPL released in 2015.  This retraction put the government procurement of foreign -\ninvested and domestically manufactured or assembled products at a competitive disadvantage, while the \ngovernment can make decisions at wi ll if the conditions are met to be considered “domestic .” \n \nInternet Policy  \n \nIn addition, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOFCOM) jointly issued a revised Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries that places \nsome Internet services under the prohibited foreig n investment industries category.  More specifically, the revised \nforeign investment catalogue indicates that foreign investment in “[n]ews websites, Internet -based video and \naudio program services, Internet services establishments, and Internet cultural op erations” is prohibited.  These  \n \n 35 \npolicies create additional barriers to market entry in the telecom sector and discourage foreign investment.  \n \nMoreover, China’s indiscriminate filtering and blocking for political purposes of online services not only \nconstitute online censorship but also a trade restriction for US firms while the Chinese firms are often operating \non the US market . Much of the blocking appears arbitrary; for example, a major home improvement site in the \nUnited States, which would appear wholly innocuous, is typical of sites likely swept up by the Great Firewall.”  \n \nFinancial Services  \n \nIt is necessary to continue to work with China to fulfill its financial services commitments under the Phase 1 \nAgreement. Without full implementation of these commitments, other foreign competitors to US financial \ninstitutions and  domestic financial services companies will continue to benefit from China’s discretion to apply \nrelaxed rules or receive licenses without the same rigorous approval process.  \n \nGovernment Drug Pricing and Reimbursement  – Pharmaceuticals  \n \nIndustry commends the Chinese government ’s efforts to better align its pricing and reimbursement system with \ninternational best practice – e.g., the establishment an annual reimbursement mechanism for the NRDL. But there \nis still more to do. Only 20 percent of new medicines launched globally in the past decade are available in China, \nand among these, fewer than 40 percent are included in the  NRDL. USCIB members urge China to continue \ntaking steps towards a more timely, transparent, predictable and evidence based NRDL.  \n \nCOLOMBIA  \n \nPRO’s Abuse of Dominant Position   \n \nIn a study conducted by Fedesarrrollo (the main economic think-tank in Colombia) named “Copyrights Market \nin Colombia” the authors concluded that “there are possibilities to improve the regulatory framework of fee \nformation mechanisms, in such a way that the protection of copyright and related rights can be promoted, w hile \nguaranteeing fair conditions of competition .”31 Additionally, in terms of competition, the Fedesarrollo´s study \nevidenced “(…) the existence of different rates for the same repertoire for users of the same industry. This is  \nunusual compared to other markets for copyright and related rights, where negotiation includes all users of the \nsame industry, so that the negoti ated rates apply to all comparable users.  \n \nPerformance rights organizations  (PROs) provide intermediary services to their affiliated members (i.e., typically \nactors, interpreters, directors, producers, etc., of music and audiovisual works) to collect on their behalf the \nroyalties that users (e.g., broadcasters, pay -TV providers, restaurants, hotels, etc.) owe them for the public \ncommunication of their works. Examples of the most relevant PROs operating in Colombia include SAYCO, \nACINPRO and EGEDA. Notwithstanding the uttermost relevance of copyright s, some PROs are abusing the \ndominant position they have as exclusive representatives of their members to charge unreasonable, discriminatory , \nand disproportionate copyright fees to users of the protected works.  \n \nIn the case of the pay-TV industry, PROs have been found not only not to have good standing to represent the \nworks of their alleged members, but also to charge asymmetric per subscriber fees to pay tv operators that use the \nsame works, with the same intensity and for the same purpose. Additi onally, when users oppose payment of such \nunreasonable fees, PROs have retaliated by initiating long and costly litigation procedures that, in some cases due \n \n31 Yepes, T., \u0026 Ramírez, M. (2019). Copyright Market in Colombia. Bogotá: Fedesarrollo. P.95   \n \n 36 \nto lack of specific IP training at the administrative and judicial decisional levels, pose significant risks for \ninvestments.  This situation is also the greatest source of tension between the PROs and users in Colombia .32 \n \nUSCIB urges USTR to press the Colombian Government to impose strict regulation on PROs , so fees are set in a \nmanner that is transparent, non -discriminatory , and proportional to the use of the works they represent. Such \nregulation should prohibit set ting asymmetric fees for pay tv providers and set regular audits to make sure the \nPROs represent the rights they say to represent and are transparent in how they distribute the collected fees.  \n \nNetwork Usage Fee  \n \nDuring its annual workshop, the Colombian Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) discussed the \npossibility of introducing a network fee tax that US content providers and technology companies would have to \npay to local internet service providers to fund telecommunications infrastructure. While there is not a formal \nproposal, there is a high risk that Colombia implements a fee that would target US companies and cause a \nsignificant financial hit, reducing their competitiveness versus foreign technology com panies. The Ministry of \nInformation and Communications Technology (ICT) has invited debate on this proposal.  \n \nVAT Taxes  \n \nThe tax regulation establishes income, VAT , and other municipal withholding taxes applicable to credential \npayments. However, this regulation has not evolved with the financial industry and has not been applied to \nidentical payments made by newer payments systems such as digital wallets, QR code pa yments, e -commerce \npayment buttons, the public real -time payment system (Bre -B), which is in the process of being implemented, and \nother payment methods such as cash. This discourages the adoption of card acceptance among merchants. \nWithholdings sum up to ~5% of transaction amount: Income: 1.5%, VAT: 2.85%, Municipal Tax: ~0.4%. The \nreduction in cash flow for merchants derived from accepting credential payments constitutes a significant barrier \nto the general adoption of credential payments acceptance. Thes e tax asymmetries create unjustified advantages \nfor companies participating with other payments methods (cash, QR, transfers) and prevents the fully successful \ndeployment of US credential companies in the country´s payment ecosystem.  \n \nPAY-TV Signal Piracy in Colombia.  \n \nUSCIB welcomes Colombian government commitment with fighting Pay -TV piracy and urges USTR to continue \nto encourage it, so the anti -piracy program is  fully  implemented . \n \nTaxes and Import Restrictions on Telecommunication Devices  and Services  \n \nThe Government of Colombia enforces  measures (decree 2025) to control the import and export of intelligent \nmobile phones, cellular mobile phones, and their parts, susceptible to classification under Customs Tariff \nsubheading 8517.12.00.00 and 8517.70.00.00,  as part of its strategy to address the theft of mobile phones.  While \nUSCIB applauds Colombia’s will to address a security concern  this measure  creates burdensome restrictions and \nadministrative requirements for trading of mobile phones, without significantly deterring or limiting the illegal \nmarket for stolen phones.  \n \nImplementation of the Decree has been extremely disruptive to businesses, as the time frames set out by the law \nwere systematically eluded and no single agency owned responsibility for addressing such shortcomings. The \n \n32 Ibid, P.83   \n \n 37 \nDecree still includes provisions that impede regular trade and commerce.  \n \nThe telecommunications ’ converged regulator has since initiated a regulatory impact analysis to address the \neffects of these measures on theft and illegal trade of mobile phones. The impact analysis showed the neglected \ncontribution of these measures to reduce this problem.  We urge the government to rethink this burdensome \napproach which still  seems not to bring an efficient solution to the issue.  \n \nIn addition, although the ICT Ministry effectively reduced the regulatory fee that the telecom and Pay -TV \ncompanies contribute for the Universal Access Fund (FONTIC) to 1.9  percent  of their gross incomes, the telecom \nactivities continue facing a multitude of fees and taxes that affects the investment of the providers. As  noted by \nthe OECD (2019) ,33 “the tax code is complex and overall taxes of a non -industry specific nature imposed on \ncompanies are high compared to other OECD countries .”34 Some of these taxes include, “ […] At the national \nlevel, the corporate tax amounts to a total of 37  percent . In addition, any financial transaction is taxed with 0.004  \npercent  of its amount. At the municipal level, an industry and commerce tax are levied and amounts to 0.2  percent  \nto 0.7  percent  for industry activities and 0.2  percent  to 1 percent  for commercial and service activities. Several \nother municipal taxes add to this, such as a property tax or specific taxes depending on each municipality .”35  \n \nWith this context, USCIB urges the USTR to request Colombia to  find ways to reduce the overall fees and taxes \non the sector (related mainly with  national and municipal taxes), in order to facilitate the adoption, trade and \ncommerce of telecom activities to achieve the benefits of a more connected society.   \n \nLocal Content on VoD Streaming Services  \n \nThe National Development Plan Law (Law 1955) passed in 2019 included a provision (Article 154) that forces \nvideo -on-demand providers to create a local content prominence section in their menus. This obligation was \nfurther implemented through Decree 681 of 2021 that include d a broad definition of audiovisual content and VoD \nservices and forces providers of streaming services to identify if the user is accessing the services from Colombia.  \n \nNational Strategy on Artificial Intelligence   \n \nThe Colombian Government presented the approved version of its Ethical Framework for AI, which is at the core \nof the national strategy on AI. The document put children at the center, introducing a set of recommendations to \nguarantee that the use of AI woul d impact children in a positive way. While the Framework adopted some good \npractices such as taking a risk -based approach for AI solutions, it also included several obligations that might lead \nto unique standards, onerous certifications, audit of algorithm s, among other concerning matters which would add \nundue burden to US companies operating in the Colombian market.  \n \nPharmaceuticals  \n \nIndustry faces market access challenges and IP  issues in Colombia. Significant market access barriers have arisen \nfrom the Government’s lack of adherence to its OCED accession agreement and keeping in  place article 72 \nrequirements for regulatory approval.  \n \n  \n \n33 OECD (2019), OECD Reviews of Digital Transformation: Going Digital in Colombia , OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/781185b1 -\nen \n34 Id, at P.48 -51 \n35 Ibid  \n \n 38 \nThe Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoH) may implement Article 72 of Law 1753  (2015) , which, as \npart of Colombia’s National Development Plan, would apply price and health technology assessment (HTA) \nmeasures for all new drugs before they could be granted marketing approval.  There is still uncertainty on value \nbase assessment frameworks and pricing setting methodology.  \n \nOther barriers include Decree 1782 (2014 ), which establishes an unprecedented “third pathway” for approval of \nnon-comparable biologics contrary to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and accepted standards of \nthe United States and other countries.  \n \n• Substandard biologics regulation : In 2014 , Colombia issued Decree 1782, which establishe d marketing \napproval evaluation requirements for all biologic medicines. As part of the Decree, Colombia  established \nan unprecedented “abbreviated” pathway for the registration of non -comparable products, which is \ninconsistent with sanitary and WHO standards and practices in the United States and other countries and \nwhich could result in the approval of medic ines that are not safe and/or effective. Industry urged the \nColombian Government to remove this third pa thway from the Decree but was unsuccessful.   \n• Regulatory challenges : Increased regulatory delays due to government policies and practices. Marketing \nauthorization backlogs:  The regulatory agency (INVIMA) has presented in the recent years several delays \nin the marketing authorization process, which increased in 2020 due to the pandemic scenario. Delays in \nterms of renewals, new approvals and modifications are highly affecting patient´s access for existent and \nnew therapies. Moreover, the launch of new therapies is being impacted due to the timeliness of the \nauthority, which  are taking up to 37 months affecting the efficiency of the system. Lack of alignment to \nregulatory Terence guidelines are also limiting the access to new therapies that are developed based on \ninnovative clinical trials that are often not accepted by the agency.  \n• Pricing regulations creates lack of predictability : Colombia is working on modifying the pricing regulation \npolicy (circular 03) which is based in IRP. Major risks have been identified regarding the potential \ninclusion of new markets into reference basket that could affect the threshold used to determine the final \nregulated price. Additionally, other risk mapped is around the frequency in which the pricing control \nmethodology will be applied (currently it is done once a year,  and the proposal considers twice a year); \nthis change in frequency creates a lack of predictability which could affect future planning. These changes \nare expected to happen at the end of 2021 for implementation in 2022. Price Based value methodology is \nalso expected to be implemented in 2022 which will also increase lack of predictability in the industry.  \n• Intellectual property : Colombia  is keen in attracting foreign investment and increase the local \nmanufacturing of vaccines and medicines. This is positive for the investment outlook and the economy, \nhowever, is decisive to guarantee that local production is based on standards of safety, efficacy,  and quality \nas well as to promote protection of the intellectual property legislation, needed to coexist innovation and \nlocal productivity of a country . \n• Compulsory  licensing : Compulsory licensing in Colombia is a continued and looming risk to \nmanufacturers of innovative medicines in the United States.  \n \nFood  Safety Risk Classifications and Plant Registrations  \n \nColombia regulation (Resolution 719) requires  plants producing high risk products to renew their registrations \nevery five years, half the previous ten -year registration period.  Plants  must re -register under Resolution 719 three \nmonths before their current registration expires.  \n \n   \n \n 39 \nUS industry is concerned that Colombia’s designation of certain products as “high risk” is not based on \ninternationally  accepted science or standards.  These comments, therefore, questioned the “high risk” categorization \nof products including:  \n \n• Dairy products, inclu ding those that are pasteurized , \n• Fortified products,  including cereals and breads , and, \n• Drinks, including bottled waters, sweetened and carbonated beverages, and fruit juices.  \n \nDigital Services Tax  \n \nIn November 2022, the Colombian government approved a tax on gross income derived by overseas providers of \ngoods and digital services into Colombia based on the concept of “significant economic presence” (SEP) (Law \n2277/22, Article 57). The tax entered int o force on January 1, 2024,  as the first digital services tax (DST) in Latin \nAmerica.  For goods and services, a person is in scope if it has a deliberate and systematic interaction with the \nColombian market (maintaining a marketing interaction with 300,000 or more users or customer s located in \nColombia) and if it obtains gross income of approximately USD 300,000 or more from users in Colombia. The \ntax applies to both the sale of tangible goods, but also to an enumerated list of digital services, including cloud \nservices. As such, th e SEP provisions apply to more than companies operating in the digital services sector.    \n \nThe rule imposes a 10% withholding tax on a non -resident with a deemed SEP in Colombia. The tax is imposed \nat the source  on the total payment made to the non -resident for the sale of goods and/or provision of services.  \nUsing other enacted DSTs and other relevant similar measures as a benchmark, the 10% proposed rate for \nwithholding is unusually high. There is an elective, alternative regime, whereby the non -resident can elect to pay \na 3% tax on the gross income derived from the sale of goods and/or the provision of digital services from abroad, \nsold, or provided to users in Colombia when registered.  \n \nThe Colombia proposals represent significant departures from international tax norms, which allocate taxing \njurisdiction on the basis of nexus (i.e., the concept of permanent establishment, physical operations, workforce, \netc.) or source (the location of i ncome -generating activity), rather than destination -based criteria. The proposal \ndoes not align with the current ongoing negotiations at the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and \nDevelopment (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework and violates the spirit of bo th the 2021 DST standstill \nagreement, and the conditional, one -year extension reached in July 2023. The Colombia government agreed to \nboth extensions, but still moved forward. This gross -basis tax imposed on non -residents of Colombia on income \nderived from  sales to the Colombian market creates barriers to trade to US companies engaging with the \nColombian market.   \n \nThe SEP provisions may constitute a violation of the trade principles of non -discrimination and not requiring a \nlocal presence, as well as the provisions of the United States -Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (USCTPA), \nwhich provides for duty -free treatme nt on US exports to Colombia. The new tax imposed on a US company that \nis deemed to have an SEP is the equivalent of a tariff in that it raises the price of imported goods and does not \naffect domestically produced products. With regard to the SEP imposed on providers of digital services, the tax \nde facto discrim inates against US service suppliers of digital services. These features of the new tax potentially \nviolate several commitments under the USCTPA including Articles 2.3 (no new customs duties on originating \ngoods), 2.8 (no restrictions on the importation of any goods of anot her party) and 15.3 (no new customs, duties, \nfees, or other charges on digital products) under the USCTPA.  \n \n   \n \n 40 \nIn addition, Article 11.5 of the USCTPA prohibits Colombia from requiring that US service suppliers have a local \npresence as a condition for the cross -border supply of a service.   The decreased 3% tax rate for those non -residents \nwho elect to file a return creates an incentive to establish a local presence, as Colombian legislation does not have \nprocedures for foreign entities without a permanent presence in Colombia to file an inc ome tax return.   \nConsequently, in order for a non -Colombian to benefit from the lower rate, it is de facto necessary for the non -\nresident to establish a local presence.  \n \nData Localization  \n \nIn May 2023, the Government of Colombia contracted through the Inter -American Development Bank a technical \nanalysis in strengthening the governance and deployment of the necessary data infrastructure to improve the \nadministration, storage, analytics, avail ability and sovereignty (security) of the State's data, ensuring the \nmassification of public services to citizens and massifying the use of information exchange systems between \npublic entities through the creation of a Private Cloud for the Government. Th is project seeks to determine the \ncurrent and projected 10 -year needs for the storage, analysis and management of data for 100% of the national \ngovernment entities, in order to safeguard data and protect critical infrastructures and achieve efficiency in t he \ninvestment of public resource s. \n \nMost recently, in September  2023, a cyber -attack targeted IFX Networks, a local IT service provider to 46 public \nentities in Colombia, 21 of which use its data center services purchased through the Private Cloud Framework \nAgreement. The attack took the form of ransomware and affected  more than 700 machines, encrypting \ninformation from approximately 762 companies in Latin America (mainly Colombia and Chile). Chile's public \nprocurement platform - http://www.mercadopublico.cl/  - suffered downtime due to the attack. In Colombia, \ngovernment agencies, including the Superior Council of the Judiciary, the Ministries of Health and Culture, and \nthe Superintendence of Industry and Commerce, also had their websites affected. This cyber -attack has led to \nconfusion and misinformation about the differences between private, public cloud and traditional infrastructure; \nstatements that promote the idea of minimizing cloud in favor of \"on -premises\" infrastructure for critical \ngovernment service s; and positioning data sovereignty as the solution to cybercrime. In Colombia, following these \nattacks, René Guarín, Chief of Technology and Information Systems of the President’s Office, added to the \nconfusion as he called for further data localization.  \n \nExpedited Customs Procedures Express Shipments  \n \nUnder the USCTPA, Colombia committed to modernize its customs procedures through automation and the use \nof electronic systems. For example: Article 5.3 states that each party shall “provide for electronic submission and \nprocessing of information and data before arrival of the shipment to allow for the releas e of goods on arrival” and \n“employ electronic or automated systems for risk analysis and targeting.” Colombia also committed to adopt \nexpedited customs procedures for express shipments, including the full incorporation of express shipments into \nColombia’s Single Window (Articles 5.2, 5.3, and 5.7). This includes providing for the submission and processing \nof information necessary for the release of an express shipment before the express shipment arrives, and allowing \nfor a single manifest through electronic means, if possible. However, the Colombian government have yet to \nimplement these commitments and still require physical documents at the border.  \n \nATA Carnet  \n \nColombia is encouraged to take all steps necessary to implement and  launch the ATA Carnet System as soon as \npossible. Colombian Congress has already passed the Istanbul Convention package, and it has cleared the \nConstitutional Court review and process.  The public document titled, “POSITION AS REGARDS TO  \n \n 41 \nRATIFICATIONS AND ACCESSIONS CONVENTION ON TEMPORARY ADMISSIONS,”36 does not \ninclude Colombia’s ratification and accession status. We encourage USTR to take steps necessary to encourage \nColombia to formally notify the WCO of its Istanbul Convention status, and implement and launch the System, \nincluding naming the domestic  National Guaranteeing Association (NGA) and Issuing Association (IA), as soon \nas possible. ATA Carnet is the global gold standard for temporary admissions under the WTO Trade Facilitation \nAgreements. ATA Carnets are critical tools of trade facilitation an d export promotion.  \n \nRegulatory Publication,  Review , and Comment  \n \nUSCIB members have  raised concerns with the review and comment period related to proposed regulatory \namendments, which have been afforded to interested parties (i.e., importers and exporters).). Colombia should \npublish all proposed changes in Official Gazette ; provide importers, exporters and all other interested parties at \nleast a 30 -day, if not 60 -day, review and comment period ; provide  additional time, 90 -days, based on complexity  \nof regulatory proposal; and al low for and be responsive to requests for ad ditional time to provide thoughtful \ncomments by interested parties.  \n \nColombia’s New Customs Law – Decree 0659  \n \nThe challenges around publication, and review and comment remain an issue and has been raised again in the \ncontext of Decree 0659 that modified the customs regulation in Colombia. For example, the draft decree  was \npublished November 17, 2023, and comments were due December 2, 2023. In addition, USCIB Members  report \nthere are process matters on the “official publication” of subsequent draft decre es on relevant Ministry webpage \nfor public review and comments, for example. The first draft of the decree was published on November 17, 2023, \nand was open for comments until midnight on December 2, 2023. This is not an adequate window for review \nand comment by interested stakeholders.  \n \nThe decree also includes a provision for the mandatory advanced import declaration. Neither the WTO TFA \n(Article 7.1) nor the WCO Revised Kyoto Convention (Standard 3.25) establish or suggest that the presentation \nof import documentation prior to the arrival of the goods should be mandatory. The advanced import declaration \nis usually voluntary, so importers w ho use it voluntarily do so because it suits the particularities of their operation.  \n \nThe mandatory use of the advanced import declaration for all goods entering and destined for Colombia is a \nchange that would have an enormous impact on international trade operations. However, the project does not \nconsider the possibility of a gradual impl ementation or transition. This does not take into account the adjustments \nthat Colombia Customs ( DIAN ) must make to its information systems and internal procedures.   \n \nThe government of Colombia has advanced that the advanced import declaration is necessary to fight against \nsmuggling, however, it will most likely end up affecting mainly the formal business sector. In this way, and in \nspite of being presented as a trade f acilitation measure, it is evident that it is not, on the contrary, it is a measure \nwhose purpose is to substantially increase customs control.  \n \nDue to the uncertainty this proposal was creating, the National Association of Foreign Trade (ANALDEX) \nrequested the intervention of the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia.  On February 15, 2024, DIAN \nshared a second version of the draft decree, bu t it was never officially published on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nwebsite for comments. The following points were advanced into the DIAN for consideration:  \n \n36 https://www.wcoomd.org/ -/media/wco/public/global/pdf/about -us/legal -instruments/conventions -and-agreements/conventions/pg0322ea.pdf?la=en . \nUpdated May 2022, accessed September 30, 2024.    \n \n 42 \n \n• Need for AEO exception.  Because DIAN is committed to and determined to implement the mandatory \nadvanced import declaration, the trade community has reiterated the importance of an exception for AEO \ncompanies. Among the AEO program benefits is the non -filing of the advance import  declaration when \nmandatory. This benefit will be cancelled when the new system is ready.   \n• Ability to update/modify filing. At this time, there is no clarity around the fields of the import declaration \nthat DIAN will allow to be updated once the cargo arrives in the country. More clarity is needed on this \npoint, especially in cases where prior i nspection and additional services (e.g., labeling, taking of serial \nnumbers) are performed on the cargo in bonded warehouses or free trade zones (FTZs).  \n• Entry into force.  The draft decree  states that the day after the DIAN certifies the entry into operation of \nthe corresponding customs system, the mandatory advanced import declaration, among other items, will \nenter into force (be required). DIAN certification includes the activities of prom otion, training, support, \ntesting and access by the users. There has not been clarity provided on the minimum time / or timeline \ndefined for DIAN to execute these activities. In addition, industry is lacking information on what DIANs \nexpectation is for the certification process.  \n \nFollowing significant industry association pressure, on May 3, 2024, DIAN/Ministry of Finance published the \nresponse to all the comments they received for the first version of the decree.   \n \nOn May 22, 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued Decree 0659, which modifies the customs regulation. DIAN did \nnot take into account the vast majority of observations and feedback shared by the private sector, so it now appears \nthat additional decrees will h ave to be issued to correct some errors already identified in Decree 0659. In addition, \nDIAN has yet to issue the resolution regulating all the changes included in the decree.  \n \nBelow is information on the fines and penalties applicable when a shipment fails to comply with the mandatory \nadvanced import declaration. These fines and penalties are extensive, specifically the second point.  \n \n• When an advanced import declaration is not filed or is filed late (within 48 hours before arrival), the \nimporter has to pay a fine of 1% of the FOB value, not exceeding 300 Tax Value Units (around $3,500), \nper House Airway Bill (HAWB). If the importer clea rs customs without paying the fine,  a legalization \ndeclaration must be filed, paying a fine of 50% of the customs value of the merchandise . \n• If an advance import declaration is not filed or updated once the cargo arrives in country or the shipment \nremains at the port of entry for more than 2 days without clearing customs, the cargo will be legally \nabandoned and cannot be recovered.  \n \nPublication of draft laws or regulations is important in the import, export, and transit space. WTO TFA Article 2 \ndeals with the OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT, INFORMATION BEFORE ENTRY INTO FORCE,  AND \nCONSULTATIONS and covers 2.1 Opportunity to Comment and Information before Entry into Force; and 2.2 \nConsultations.  As included in the WTO TFA, bilateral dialogues and engagement should be used to promote the \nuse of an “appropriate time period” for re view of draft laws and regulations. As a general matter, this is a t least \n30 days with the ability to extended based on complexity of the proposal.  In addition, Colombia should be \nencouraged to develop and provide as much additional detail to the trade on areas tied to the new Customs \nregulation lacking clarity. This in formation should be posted in an easily accessible format on the internet and \ncirculated widely with interested stakeholders.  \n \n   \n \n 43 \nRegarding the mandatory advance import declaration, it’s important to mention that neither the Trade Facilitation \nAgreement (Article 7.1) of the World Trade Organization nor the Reviews Kyoto Convention (Standard 3.25) of \nthe World Customs Organization establish or suggest that the presentation of import documentation prior to the \narrival of the goods should be mandatory. The advance import declaration is usually voluntary, so importers w ho \nuse it voluntarily do so because it suits the particularities of th eir operation. The mandatory use of the advance \nimport declaration for all goods entering and destined for Colombia is a change that would have an enormous \nimpact on foreign trade operations. However, the project does not consider the possibility of a grad ual \nimplementation or transition. This does not consider  the adjustments that DIAN must make to its information \nsystems and internal procedures.  \n \nOther Trade Facilitation  \n \nUnder the USCTPA, Colombia committed to modernize their customs procedures through automation and the \nuse of electronic systems. For example: Article 5.3 states that each party shall “provide for electronic submission \nand processing of information and data  before arrival of the shipment to allow for the release of goods on arrival” \nand “employ electronic or automated systems for risk analysis and targeting.” Colombia also committed to adopt \nexpedited customs procedures for express shipments, including the f ull incorporation of express shipments into \nColombia’s Single Window (Articles 5.2, 5.3, and 5.7). This includes providing for the submission and processing \nof information necessary for the release of an express shipment before the express shipment arrives , as well as \nallowing for a single manifest through electronic means, if possible. However, the Colombian government have \nyet to implement these commitments and still require physical documents at the border.  \n \nCOSTA RICA  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \n• Price Controls : Costa Rica imposed caps on the fees that U.S. EPS suppliers may charge for certain cross -\nborder transactions. In March 2020, the Congress of Costa Rica enacted Law 9831 granting the Central \nBank of Costa Rica (BCCR) authority to set price control measures to the card payments system, including \na wide range of electronic service providers with operations in Costa Rica. In November 2022, the BCCR \nupdated its regulation and capped among others, the international Interchange Reimbursement Fee (XB \nIRF), and the international Merchant Discount Rate (XB MDR). The BCCR regulation affects contractual \nagreements signed between each financial institution (issuer) outside Costa Rica and its corresponding \npayment network. Costa Rica is the only country in the world that has adopted regulation that imposes \ncaps on international interchange fees and goes against international best practices. Costa Rica should \nclarify that Law 9831 applies to domestic transactions and not to international transactions and revoke \ncaps on fees  charged by U.S. EPS for cross -border transactions now and in the future. We recommend a \nmore active participation from the American Government with the Government of Costa Rica, to support \nthe legislative initiatives that seek to provide a solution to thi s issue and to find a solution in line with \nglobal best practices.  \n \n• Tax asymmetry : The tax regulation establishes that payments to merchants using cards are subject to a tax \nwithholding which accounts up to 8% of the transaction value. However, this regulation has not evolved \nwith the financial industry and does not consider newer paymen ts systems. While designed as a P2P \nplatform, Sinpe Movil, the Central Bank’s mobile platform for Costa Rica’s National System of Electronic \nPayments (SINPE), is increasingly utilized by local merchants and competes with other payment methods, \nincluding de bit and credit cards on the payment to merchant market and it is not subject to such tax \nwithholding. This creates a significant uneven playing field as users are encouraged to use those systems  \n \n 44 \nthat generate lower economic burdens, leading to a competitive disadvantage for US card companies. This \nis aggravated as the Central Bank is simultaneously a competitor as operator of Sinpe Movil and also the \npayments sector regulator, creating a conflict of interest.  \n \n• Discriminatory practices : US based card companies are subject to regulation and supervision, including \nsystemic and price control regulations, by a government agency (Central Bank of Costa Rica), while our \ncompetitor Sinpe Movil is not subject to equivalent regulation and supervisi on by a third -party agency. \nThis creates a discriminatory effect as the burden of regulation and supervision only falls on US based \ncompanies and not similarly on its domestic competitor.  \n \nCROATIA  \n \nPublic Procurement Barriers  \n \nUS companies face significant barriers in Croatia’s public procurement market due to technical standards favoring \nEU-based suppliers. Tenders often require compliance with EU certifications, such as CE -marking and data \nresidency, particularly for cloud ser vices, infrastructure and technology projects. These requirements force US \ncompanies to adapt their offerings to meet EU specifications, incurring additional costs and operational \ncomplexity. In addition, procurement processes are primarily conducted in Croatian, adding language and \nprocedural barriers, and the slow, bureaucrati c nature of the system further complicates participation for foreign \nbidders.  \n \nCYPRUS  \n \nData Sovereignty Barriers  \n \nUS CSPs face significant barriers in Cyprus due to strict data sovereignty rules, particularly when providing \nservices to the public sector or regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services. These rules require \nsensitive data, such as persona l health records or financial transactions, to be stored and processed within Cyprus \nor the EU. These requirements mean that US CSPs must either establish local data centers or partner with local \nproviders to offer their services to covered entities. Add itionally, Cyprus’s public procurement framework often \nspecifies data residency requirements for government contracts, making it difficult for US providers to compete.  \n \nCZECH REPUBLIC  \n \nCloud Technology Usage Barriers  \n \nCzech law requires CSPs to register under a Cloud Computing Catalog, which is onerous for US companies. With \na new Cybersecurity Law being adopted, users will face further administrative burdens when using US cloud \nservices.  \n \nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC  \n \nPharmaceuticals  \n \nDominican Republic should reform its procurement legislation to  provide clear rules and accelerate access to \ninnovative medicines (PMAC and Promise  reform etc .). Also, a modern vaccination law is required where \ndecisions are based on scientific evidence and technical data.   \n \n 45 \n \nLocal regulation for biotherapeutics is based on WHO requirements, however Dominican Republic Regulatory \nAgency does not follow these guidelines and non -comparable biotherapeutics are approved in the country, \ncreating a risk for the patient and unfair comp etition.  \n \nECUADOR  \n \nState -owned Enterprises (SOEs)  \n \nEcuador’s more protectionist path in public policy  has result ed in a series of exceptions and exemptions that favor \nnational SOEs in the marketplace. This has impaired competition and is inconsistent with Ecuador’s national \ntreatment obligations under the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty , which threatens US investment in the \ncountry . \n \nAs way of example, the Ecuadorian government has put in place regulatory burdens on the private \ntelecommunication sector while granting preferential treatment to CNT, Ecuador’s SOE.37 Such preferential \ntreatment exempts CNT from complying with the following general obligations:  \n \n• Participate in public auctions for spectrum  \n• Pay federal l icense and spectrum fees  \n• Comply with municipal permitting requirements and taxes t o deploy network infrastructure  \n• Pay a gradually increasing fee based on mark et share participation above 30 percent  \n• Reduce the amount of telecommunications equipment imported into Ecuador ; and  \n• Comply with sector sp ecific accounting requirements  \n \nCNT has traditionally been the incumbent operator for the fixed -line services in Ecuador with 2 million \nsubscribers (84 percent), while its competitors combined have approximately 360,000 subscribers. In the Pay -TV \nmarket, CNT has rapidly grown to become t he second -largest provider with approximately 354,00 subscribers \n(29 percent).  \n \nIn order to assure fair market access to private operators in Ecuador, USCIB urges USTR to encourage the \nEcuadorian government to adopt equitable and nondiscriminatory measures that allow US investments in Ecuador \nto compete fairly with SOEs.  \n \nDiscriminatory Tax on the Telecommunications Sector: Market Share Tax  and ICE ( Special Consumption Tax) \n \nForeign investment in Ecuador’s telecommunication market is jeopardized by  the country’s excessive and \ndiscriminatory taxation policy.  Particularly, Ley Organica de Telecomunicaciones s impose s a new tax on \nproviders whose investments and presence in the country have allowed them to grow over 30  percent  of the \nmarket.  Art. 34 of the Ley Organica de Telecomunicaciones ordered that those providers with 30  percent  market \nshare must be charged an additional regulatory fee equal to 0.5  percent  of gross revenues, and for each 5  percent  \nof additional market share , thereafter, are charged an additional tax equal to 1  percent  of gross revenue. The 30 \npercent  threshold only impacted three foreign providers  in the Pay -TV market.  \n \n37 Expert market reports confirm that Ecuador’s regulatory measures to favor CNT are part of a protectionist scheme sustained ov er time. See for \nexample BMI Research’s analysis for Ecuador, available at http://www.bmiresearch.com/ecuador , last accessed August 27, 2015.  [“Regulatory \nchanges at the beginning of 2015 continue to advance the more controversial aspects of operating in Ecuador's telecoms market . In the past, the \ngovernment has shown a tendency to protect  CNT  from private competition and the new regulation instituted during 2015 will not change this trend, \nwith additional taxation and high cost of 4G spectrum licenses.”].   \n \n 46 \n \nIn addition, there is a tax that applies to certain telecommunications services ICE (special consumption tax). This \ntax is normally applied to sumptuous goods or those that may harm health. Currently it applies to corporate plans \nof the fixed and mobile service and to internet , audio , and video subscription services. ICE represents the \nconsumer an increase of 15  percent  in its invoice.  \n \nUSCIB urges USTR to request the Ecuadorian government to dismantle the market share tax and special \nconsumption tax (ICE) so that all telecommunication providers can compete on a level playing field which would \nultimately enhance competitiveness in the sector besides offering users a wid er variety of options .  \n \nTaxes on Telecommunication Devices  \n \nEcuador has a high tariff on several technology products, including computers, tablets , and smartphones in the \n10-15 percent  range and between 15 -20 percent  for satellite dishes and decoders,  compared with other countries \nin the region . USCIB urges the USTR to ask Ecuador to purposefully move forward with the tariff reduction for \nsmartphones, tablets, computing devices and satellite dishes and decoders to facilitate the adoption, trade , and \ncommerce of these devices to achieve the benefits of a more connect ed society.   \n \nVAT \n \nCurrent tax regulation establishes income and VAT withholdings applicable to credential payments which \ndiscourage the adoption of card acceptance among merchants. Simplified tax regimen “RIMPE” establishes an \nexemption from these withholdings only for taxp ayers (individuals and legal persons) with an annual income \nranging from USD 1 to USD20.000, but any other taxpayer is subject to withholdings up to ~13% of transaction \namount. The reduction in cash flow for merchants derived from accepting credential paym ents constitutes a \nsignificant barrier to the general adoption of credential payments acceptance and prevents the fully successful \ndeployment of US credential companies in the country´s payment ecosystem.  \n \nTariffs and Concession Rights Regulation for Using Radio Spectrum  \n \nAfter the  enactment  of the 2015 Telecommunications Law in Ecuador , few changes were made to attract \ninvestment for radio spectrum. Art. 54 of the Telecommunications Law encourages the development of \ntelecommunications through the establishment of tariffs and concession rights based on the valuation of the \nradioelectric spectrum, coverage , and incentives for investments. In a study published by the Inter -American \nDevelopment Bank in 2018, it mentions that Ecuador has the highest regulatory payments in Latin America, only \nbehind Peru.  USCIB urges USTR to encourage the Ecuadorian government to reform the tariffs and concession \nrights for use spectrum in order to promote good competition in the telecommunication sector.  \n \nNutrition Labeling  \n \nEcuador requires all food products to comply with labeling provisions , including a set of colored bars, traffic light \nsymbols that reflect a low, medium, or high content of salt, sugar, and fat in the product, based on limits established \nfor these nutrients.  For food packages smaller than 14.4 cm, instead of a traffic light label, an advisory message is \nrequired stating, “For your health, reduce the consumption of this product.”  An advisory statement is also required \nfor foods that contain less than 50 perc ent “natural” content.  Ecuador defines a “natural food” as “a food as \npresented in nature  that has not been transformed. ”  \n \n   \n \n 47 \nEcuador also  maintains  Service for Standardization (INEN) requirements for a certificate to demonstrate \ncompliance with the labeling elements.  The certificates of conformity (COC) may only be issued by the Ecuadorian \nAccreditation Agency (OAE), or an OAE accredited inspection body or designee, as established under existing \nmutual recognition agreements with Ecuador.  All processed and pre -packaged foods with the new traffic light \nlabels must also be reregistered under Ecuador’s cumbersome Sanitary Registrati on process.   \n \nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers  \n \nAll agricultural imports require an SPS certificate issued by Ecuador’s animal and plant health service \n(AGROCALIDAD).  Importers complain the certification process is lengthy and burdensome.  They also complain \nthat the certificate process lacks scientific basis, is at odds with World Organization for Animal Health and Codex \nAlimentarius Commission standards and is used to block imports that compete with domestic production of meat \nproducts, da iry products, and produce.  AGROCALIDAD require s an SPS certificat e for processed agricultural \nproducts, including low -risk (cooked) products.  Importers of US products, especially US  fast food franchisees, \nreported import processing delays caused by confusion among government agencies over how to enforce the \nresolution and by officials intentionally delaying the entry of imported products as part of Ecuador’s policy of \nimport substitut ion. \n \nData Localization Requirements  \n \nEcuador's National Assembly adopted the Personal Data Protection Law in May 2021. The Ecuadorian legislation \nestablishes that public sector entities that contract software services or others that involve the location of data, \nmust do so with providers that guarantee that the data remains in country and is in data centers that comply wit h \ninternational standards on security and protection.  For all data related to national security and strategic sectors \n(the Ecuadorian Constitution defines a list of strategic  sectors: energy in all its forms, telecommunications, non -\nrenewable natural resources, transportation and refining of hydrocarbons, biodiversity , and genetic heritage, the \nradioelectric spectrum and water) should be in computer centers located in Ecuadorian territory.  Data of relevance \nto the state that is not related to national security or strategic sectors should preferably be found in computer \ncenters located in Ecuadorian territory or in countries with data protection standards equal to or more demand ing \nthan those established in Ecuador.  \n \nEGYPT  \n \nTariffs  \n \nIn November 2021, Egypt imposed a new 10% tariffs on imports of mobile phones, the stated reason for which \nwas to stimulate and protect local industry.38  The tariff increase is inconsistent with Egypt’s commitments under \nthe WTO Information Technology Agreement.  \n \nSocial Media Law  \n \nEgypt  requires all social media users with more than 5,000 followers to procure a license from the Higher Council \nfor Media Regulation.  Reports continue to show the government’s increased use of censorship, website blocking, \nand mandated content filtering.39  \n \n38 https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/443436.aspx  \n39 Freedom on the Net 2020: Egypt  (2020), https://freedomhouse.org/country/egypt/freedom -net/2020 (“ At the end of the first quarter of 2020, 546 \nwebsites were reported blocked by the authorities.”).   \n \n 48 \n \nEgyp t enforces a strict licensing regime on media and press outlets , including online platforms .40 Further, \ninternational companies are obligated to open a representative office within the country, while naming a liable \nlegal and content removal point of contact.  There are no safe harbor protections for foreign companies, and the \nregulation stipulates an average of $200k in licensing fees (which could conflict with the Media law of 2018).  \n \nDomestic Payment Infrastructure  \n \nCentral Bank of Egypt (CBE) ambitions to promote domestic payment infrastructure (scheme) and push for co -\nbadge with international payment networks is forcing such networks to adjust their business models in accordance \nwith the government's political ambit ions to enhance  \n \nCustoms and Trade Facilitation  \n \nEgypt is in the process of implementing its Single Window system, tied commitments under the WTO TFA, for \nall shipment types using a third -party Single -Window (SW) operator and a third party pay -for block chain provider \nCargoX41 for document transfer for the Advanced Cargo Information (ACI) System.  While  USCIB support s \nestablishment of country systems to implement Single Window systems, which provide importers greater trade \nfacilitation, there are concerns with respect to the approach being taken by Egypt.  \n \nEgypt ’s Customs Law No. 207 of 2020 includes implementation of Egypt’s Single Window one -stop shop website \nfor import and export document transfer.  \n \nOriginally, the mandatory Advanced Cargo Information (ACI) filing was to be effective July 1, 2021, for ocean \nshipments into the seaports, where the ACI Declaration (ACID) number is to be included on all shipment \ndocuments submitted or sent through CargoX Platform, for example. F or failure s to include ACID , “the goods \nwill not be cleared and will be returned without discharge at the port. ” The Decree of the Minister of Finance (No. \n378) for the year 2021 Amending s ome provisions of Decree No. 38 of 2021, de layed the mandatory entry into \nforce of ACI submissions for ocean cargo until October 1, 2021.  Implementation for these shipments began, \nOctober 1, 2021, with the established processing fee for each shipment ($50 but companies are required to by \ncredits) as established by the Egyptian Government. Importers were notified, after implementation, that t he \ngovernment authorized a tripling of the processing fee (to $150/credits) for each shipment as of October 14, 2021, \nwhich significantly increasing costs to imp orters. Fees are separately due for each document set if there are \nmultiple importers. Credits are not refundable. In addition, because the set fees are government mandated there is \nno ability for importers to negotiate rates independently with CargoX.  \n \nThe ACI FAQ  provides the following as it relates to cost: “ The total cost of ACI filing consists of two parts - the \nACI filing processing fee  and the cost of blockchain document transfer . These fees are paid by the exporter. As \nof October 14, 2021, the cost for the ACI filing processing fee is $150 (150 units) per ACID number.  “It is my \nunderstanding that the processing fee has tripled as of October 14 from 50 to 150 US dollars . “EXAMPLE:  If your \nACI filing includes 4 documents ( see the list of required ACI documents ), the blockchain document transfer cost \nwill be $12. The total cost in this case is 150 + 12 = 162 USD (162 units). But if you are sending 5 or more \ndocuments for the same ACID number, the maximum total price per ACI filing is capped at 165 USD.”  \n \n40 The New Press and Media Regulation Era in Egypt , LEXOLOGY  (May 16, 2020), https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=36e4982b -40ef-\n4fb5-9ee6 -f4912a7271ac.  \n41 Misr Technology Services “MTS”, the operator of the national single window for Egyptian trade across borders platform, has au thorized CargoX \nas the blockchain document transfer gateway for the Advance Cargo Information System. Source: https://cargox.io/pr ess-releases/CargoX -Egypt -\nMTS -Nafeza -ACI/  \n \n 49 \nImplementation for air cargo is expected in 2022; however, information related to implementation has not been \nshared with members of the trading community.  \n \nTo date, members have noted that there are several steps, which must take place in advance to shipment, including: \nestablish  an account in Nafeza (local customs system)  by importer ; request via Nafeza for ACID number on \nshipment level before the shipment leaves the departure port; and communicate this number to exporter and \napprove documents received via blockchain from exporter.  In addition, the exporter or seller to Egypt must: create \naccount in CargoX blockchain system; include ACID number on all documen ts; upload documents to CargoX \n(e.g., invoice must  be uploaded in Excel document format on the layout developed by Egyptian government, etc.); \nand these documents will be transferred from CargoX to Nafeza and submitted to importer for approval.  There is \nno process for high -sea sales, in such case, new ACID numbers must be generated by importers subject to fines \nof 20,000 EGP and 100 USD.  \n \nUSCIB members have expressed that: there is an overall lack of transparency by the Egyptian government, where \ninstructions are only being offering in Arabic; there is additional concern related to CargoX as it is not only a third \nparty, it is a third party located in a third country; t hey have had difficulties in obtaining responses or guidance to \nopen questions, specifically as it relates to enquires to Nafeza; there have been challenges in establishing \nmandated accounts; and the Egyptian government has fa iled to issue timely advanced notice of changes to the \ntrade community (e.g., an October 13 CargoX notice tied to an October 14 processing fee increase) as well as, for \nexample,  IT requirements to allow for necessary programming. Moreover, there are challenges related to \nconflicting and contrary information. Escalation points are not clear, and impression is that even on the Egyptian \ngovernment side there is lack of full system set -up understanding, hence there is no clear path to address \nnonstandard questi ons falling out of published ACI FAQ.  \n \nFrom an importer perspective, the required changes include such things as IT development, which must be \nconsidered and clearly communicated in advance to the trade community. For example, the authorities have yet \nto publish the specific IT specifications o r a go -live date. Appropriate lead -time is necessary, it takes business \ntime to design and develop complex IT solutions and this lack of clarity may result in solution failure. A business \nneeds certainty of requirements at least six months in advance to be  successful.  \n \nAs a general matter, third party establishment and operation of SWs raises its own concerns related to data and \ninteroperability, including but not limited to data security, treatment of confidential business information (CBI), \nas well as concerns over una pproved access and selling or sharing of trade data, and data sharing as well as under \nwhat controls, couple this with a third party blockchain provider for document transfer in a third country and \nconcerns of the trade are heightened.  \n \nPharmaceutical Pricing  \n \nGovernment pricing is not clear, fair nor transparent. There is a need for pricing policies that enhance timely \naccess to treatment, based on transparency and predictability and consistent with international trade agreements.  \n \nIntellectual property   \n \nEgypt does not have a patent linkage system, allowing the Ministry of Health to grant regulatory approval for \ncopies of innovator products that still have a valid patent. Egypt also lacks RDP and effective patent enforcement. \nThis allows local manufacturer s to obtain market authorization for generic products before the originator's patent \nexpires. Accordingly, there is a need for stronger IP protection.  \n  \n \n 50 \nPrivacy  \n \nIn 2020, Egypt enacted the Data Protection Law , imposing  significant administrative and regulatory burdens on all \nentities operating in Egypt  with no exemptions based on  an organization’s size.  Key requirements include : \n• Sensitive personal data, including explicit consent to process (exemption for entities under Central Bank \nsupervision), including DPO appointment requirement and data breach notification obligations , \n• Records of Processing required , \n• Grounds for processing and cross -border data transfers are limited , \n• Restrictions on re -use of data by organizations , \n• Licenses are required for several activitie s, and, \n• Imprisonment and fines for non -compliance, up to $320,000 per violation; personal criminal liability for \nresponsible managers and for Data Protection Officer (DPO).  \n \nETHIOPIA  \n \nDigital Payment Services  \n \nDespite 2023 regulation to open the digital payment market to foreign operators to issue payment instruments and \noperate payment systems, only Kenya -based Safaricom has obtained a license to issue payment instruments with \na reportedly high investment prote ction fee (USD 150m). Such a high expectation of a fee to allow international \npayment networks to obtain a license to operate payment systems is a barrier to allowing more international \ncompanies the opportunity to operate in the market and generate econom ic growth.  \n \nEUROPEAN UNION  \n \nUS-EU Trade and Technology Council  \n \nThe US and the EU launched the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) in 2021 with the goal  to coordinate \napproaches to key global technology, economic and trade issues, and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic \nrelations. USCIB commends the US -EU TTC  for its effort  to demonstrate a joint commitment for open, \ntransparent, and market -economy based trade and digital ecosystems across the Atlantic. We laud the TTC for \nadvancing  dialogue and convergence  in important areas of trade and technology. We urge a continuance  of this \ndialogue , with USTR working  to ensure that the EU’s digital agenda does not unfairly target US companies in \norder to prevent them from operating in Europe, and to provide adequate transparency and consultation to ensure \nthat they do not disadvantage US companies, undermine cybersecurity, and impose unreasonable restrictions on \ndata flows.  \n \n‘A Europe Fit for a Digital Age’42 \n \n“Digital sovereignty” or “strategic autonomy” are key  themes of concerns for American providers in Europe, in \nparticular around cloud computing, data localization and supply chain policies . EU policymakers should  adopt \nlegislation which embraces the global nature of the technology industry and avoids fragmented, protectionist \npolicies.  This is particularly the case for policies linked to cybersecurity.  While the EU Cybersecurity Act  calls \nfor providers of digital services in the EU to adopt voluntary certifications – which may be based on existing or \nplanned international cybersecurity standards – it is still possible that such standards will become de facto  \nmandatory if referenced in national legislation.   \n \n42 See https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities -2019 -2024/europe -fit-digital -age_en    \n \n 51 \n \nSimilarly, the EU  Directive on Network and Information Systems (NIS) also  allow s EU member states to require \nentities to certify certain ICT products, services , and processes under adopted European cybersecurity certification \nschemes under the Cybersecurity Act and give s the European Commission the power to adopt delegated acts \nspecifying which entities should be required to obtain a certificate.  A framework that forces companies to meet \nstandards has been widely seen as undermining the goal of improving se curity, which given the ever -evolving \nnature of technology and threats, does not lend itself to static and inflexible solutions.  Also, the European \nCybersecurity Competence Centre allows for the restriction of certain funds to entities with an EU establishment \nbut controlled from third (non -EU countries), enabling for the discrimination between different companies legally \nestablishe d in the EU.  \n \nPolicy and regulatory frameworks should distinguish between consumer and enterprise services. Generally, \nenterprise services should be explicitly excluded from the scope of consumer -focused legislation, which in an \nenterprise context may be unnecessarily b urdensome, harm investment in innovative services provided to \nenterprises and impact business freedom in contractual negotiations. As an example, the adopted “ European \nElectronic Communication Code” recognizes the difference in some part s of the text but f ails to have it \nconsistently reflected throughout the text.  \n \nConnected devices are rapidly expanding, improving our lives and industrial operations.  The vast potential of  \nemerging technologies for  society  and the economy will be realized only in a flexible , investment friendly,  \nregulatory and policy climate . Policymakers should strive to better understand the benefits and potential issues \nthat arise in the context of new technologies including Artificial Intelligence , Big Data, IoT, and the continued \ngrowth of platforms and search tools. Forward -looking policy positi ons should include a review of legacy \nregulation with a rigorous economic analysis of changed market conditions.   \n \nIn particular, we urge the Commission to carefully reflect upon the OECD’s Internet Policymaking Principles ,43 \na comprehensive and balanced set of principles developed by the OECD with input from all stakeholders including \nBusiness at OECD, of which USCIB is the US  affiliate, to guide development and implementation of effective \nand compatible approaches to Internet policymaking and governance both at the national and international levels. \nThe Commission should ensure that policy and regulatory elements of the DSM rem ain consistent with these \nOECD Principles.  \n \nUSTR should work with European counterparts to ensure that any legislative proposals are consistent with \ninternational obligations and avoid creating uncertainty for businesses.  \n \nWe praise the EU for adopting the regulation on free flow of non -personal data. Such policies are critical for the \ndigital economy to thrive, yet various countries have introduced server and data localization requirements, (e.g., \ndata retention) and simila r measures in recent years, often under the false pretense of improving data security. \nSuch measures not only create a self -imposed economic handicap but also set a dangerous precedent for other \ncountries, thereby encouraging them to adopt similar restrict ions. Such ‘digital data protectionism’ undermines \nglobal trade in goods and services and threatens the development of a truly global digital economy.  \n \nThe agreed Free Flow of Data R egulation establish es a framework of free cross -border data flows within the EU, \nwhich would limit the scope of data localization requirements imposed by EU Member States to those required \non grounds of public security. We welcome the regulation and urge the European Commission to ensure its full \n \n43 See https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd -principles -for-internet -policy -making.pdf    \n \n 52 \nand consistent implementation  by EU Member States to prevent any unjustified data localization requirements \nand to remove any existing unjustified requirement.  \n \nWe further note that the “extraterritorial application of the GDPR” is having unintended consequence on third and \ninterested p arties’ access to ICANN’s WHOIS registry. The WHOIS registry is a critical tool used for \ncybersecurity and intellectual property infringement purposes by companies and security researchers and law \nenforcement officials.  The implementation of  GDPR curtailed access to WHOIS registration information , having \na significant effect on intellectual property enforcement efforts and the abilit y of legitimate rights holders to take \naction against infringers and bad actors, including those responsible for malware, botnet attacks, phishing schemes \netc. We call on the EU to work closely with ICANN and guide them towards  an implementable solution that \nallows access to WHOIS information for legitimate, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and law enforcement \npurposes.   \n \nEU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS)  \n \nThe EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been developing a European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme \nfor Cloud Services (EUCS) since 2020. The EU’s 2019 Cybersecurity Act established a legal basis for EU -wide \ncybersecurity certification schemes. In a February 2022 Commission Staff Working Document, the EU identified \n“cloud and edge computing” as a strategic dependency for Europe, noting that “the EU cloud market is led by a \nfew large cloud providers headquartered outside the EU.” In June 2022, ENISA am ended the draft certification \nscheme to introduce four new criteria – including immunity from foreign law – for CSPs to qualify for the highest \ncybersecurity certification level in EUCS. If this proposal were adopted, only companies with their head office \nand global headquarters in an EU Member State would be eligible to certify at the highest level of EUCS, which \nwill likely be a prerequisite for providing cloud services to the public sector and select private sector organizations. \nThis would effectively p revent US companies from providing services to covered entities in the EU. In March \n2024, due to pushback from industry and a majority of EU Member States, ENISA proposed removing the \nsovereignty requirements from EUCS, but the process has stalled due to French opp osition. Provisions that \ndiscriminate on the basis of ownership violate the EU’s trade obligations under the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).  \n \nEU Telecoms Strategy  \n \nIn 2022, the European Commission launched a consultation to evaluate the possibility of requiring content and \napplication providers “of a certain size” to bear part of the cost of the development of telecoms infrastructure in \nEurope. This levy, supported b y European telecoms operators, would initially require six US companies to pay \n€20 billion annually to telecoms operators to support infrastructure development.  \n \nDespite strong opposition from a majority of stakeholders, including EU Member States, consumer associations, \ntelecoms regulators and industry, the Commiss ion developed a similar proposal in a more recent White Paper on \nthe future of Europe’s digital infrastructure, published in February 2024. In it, the Commission proposes extending \nthe EU regulatory framework for telecoms to CSPs (including an arbitration mechanism requiring them to pay \ninterconnection fees to telecoms operators) and establishing ‘universal service obligations’ requiring ‘digital \nplayers’ to co -finance telecoms infrastructure in remote and rural areas. Despite continued opposition, the \nComm ission is being supported by strong lobbying from large European telecoms operators, as well as two recent \nreports on the competitiveness of the EU authored by former Italian Prime -Ministers Enrico Letta and Mario \nDraghi.  \n \n   \n \n 53 \nEU AI Act  \n \nThe EU AI Act establishes a horizontal risk -based framework to regulate AI systems in the EU. The Regulation \nentered into force in August 2024, triggering the gradual phase -in of its provisions over a 36 -month period. It will \nnow be supplemented by Impleme nting Acts and standards to operationalize its requirements for general -purpose \nAI, foundation models and high -risk AI.  \n \nCEN and CENELEC, the European standardization bodies, have launched a dedicated technical committee (JTC \n21) to develop harmonized standards that will support the implementation of the AI Act, including a framework \nfor AI trustworthiness and standards for AI risk management and quality assurance. It remains unclear whether \nthese standards will be consistent with existing ISO standards (e.g., ISO 42001). Divergent standards would \nrequire businesses to adapt to EU -specific requirements.  \n \nThe AI Act will also require providers of general -purpose AI models to disclose a “sufficiently detailed” summary \nof their model training data. The European Commission is currently developing a template for these disclosures. \nIf the template requires granu lar disclosure of training data, it could impinge on the IP and trade secrets of model \ndevelopers. Moreover, Recital 106 of the AI Act also foresees that “any provider placing a general -purpose AI \nmodel on the Union market should comply with [the Regulatio n’s copyright obligations] regardless of the \njurisdiction in which the copyright -relevant acts underpinning the training of those general -purpose AI models \ntake place”. If the AI Act imposes more stringent requirements or compliance costs on AI models trai ned outside \nthe EU, this could contravene WTO MFN principles.  \n \nRevision of the EU Procurement Directives  \n \nThe EU Procurement Directives establish core requirements for public procurement procedures across all EU \nMember States and public entities. In a Mission Letter sent to the Executive Vice -President -designate for \nProsperity and Industrial Strategy on September 17, 2024, President von der Leyen outlined her plan to “revise \nthe Public Procurement Directives to [...] enable preference for European products in public procurement for \ncertain strategic sectors and technologies .” \n \nProposal for a Foreign Investment Screening Regulation  \n \nIn January 2024, the European Commission published a proposal for a new foreign investment screening \nRegulation. The Regulation seeks to harmonize core requirements for national FDI screening procedures across \nall EU Member States and  would require Member States to create new filing requirements and regulatory \nclearance procedures for certain investments. Most significantly, the Regulation would require all Member States \nto impose an ex ante  authorization requirement on all foreign investments targeting companies that (i) are active \nin one of 42 listed “critical technology areas”, (ii) are subject to dual -use or military export controls, (iii) provide \ncritical financial or healthcare services , or (iv) participate in a listed EU funding program. Given the breadth of \nthe sectors targeted by the proposal, and the lack of differentiation between the risk profiles of investors, the \nRegulation would likely impose a large burden on US investors.  \n \nEU Space Law  \n \nThe European Commission is expected to publish a draft EU Space Law in H1 2025. Although there is relatively \nlittle information regarding the content of the Law, the Commission has publicly stated its intention to create an \nasymmetric regulatory regime whe re ‘small’ satellite operators are subject to a lighter regime than ‘larger’ \noperators (e.g., constellations). This asymmetric approach would impose higher compliance costs on US  \n \n 54 \nconstellations (e.g., Starlink, Kuiper) than EU operators. The EU Space Law may also restrict certain \ncommunications services to EU -headquartered satellite operators (similarly to EUCS).  \n \nProposal for a Financial Information for Data Access (FIDA) Regulation  \n \nThe European Parliament and the Council of the EU are evaluating the exclusion of DMA gatekeepers from the \nframework of the draft FIDA Regulation and  considering establishing additional safeguards preventing platforms \nas a whole from accessing financial services data -sharing schemes.  \n \nDigital Markets Act (DMA) Implementation  \n \nThe DMA, which was concluded in the first half of 2022 and entered into force in November 2022 despite US \ngovernment concerns regarding the discriminatory treatment of US companies, creates significant and \nburdensome requirements for 6 US companies and one Chinese firm – but no European companies. The regulatory \napproach to impose “one -size-fits-all” obligations to different digital services with different business models is \ninadequate and could hamper innovation. The DMA restricts the use  of data, creates new data access and \nportability obligations, and introduces interoperability requirements with a short implementation period and the \nthreat of significant penalties. Despite commitments made by the EC to the Biden administration before the DMA \nwas finalize d, no European companies were designated as “gatekeepers”. On September 6, 2023 the EC \ndesignated 22 core platform services as gatekeepers, from 6 companies: Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, ByteDance, \nMeta and Microsoft as gatekeepers. Booking.com, which is owned  by US parent company Booking Holdings, \nwas designated as a gatekeeper in 2024. Gatekeepers needed to comply with DMA’s substantive obligations \nwithin 6 months , with the EC as the main enforcer.  \n \nData Act  \n \nThe Data Act regulates access to and transfer of data generated by connected products and related services in the \nEU. The Regulation entered into force in January 2024, and its main provisions will begin to apply from \nSeptember 2025. The Regulation will fo rce sharing of data and the transfer of trade secrets under certain \nconditions. It also creates new discriminatory barriers for “gatekeepers” designated under the DMA. In particular, \nusers will not be able to utilize a new portability right established by  the Data Act to transfer their data to \n“gatekeepers.” The Data Act further creates new obligations for cloud service providers on the access and transfer \nof non -personal data following third country access requests, leading to a new potential conflict of EU and third -\ncountry law. According to the Data Act’s impact assessment, concerns over unlawful access to data by authorities \nnot subject to EU legislation is one of the main drivers for the data access and transfer restriction, which implies \nan equivalenc e between US and Chinese surveillance laws. Lastly, it imposes switching obligations on cloud \nservice providers where the associated costs will disproportionately fall on US CSPs because of their customer \nbase and the maturity and complexity of their service portfolio.  \n \nDigital Services Act ( DSA) Implementation  \n \nThe DSA creates new rules for the handling of illegal third -party content on hosting and intermediary services in \nEurope, such as video -sharing services, social networks, and online marketplaces. In addition, the DSA creates a \nnew classification of compani es called Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs), a grouping that disproportionately \ntargets US companies, based on a presumption that services with more than 45 million active users present \n“systemic risk” irrespective of any specific risk assessment. The D SA imposes additional restrictions on targeted \nadvertising and obligations for VLOPs and VLOSEs to provide alternative recommendation systems, despite the \nlack of any clear evidence that the size of a company indicates additional risk. The EU announced the  designation  \n \n 55 \nof VLOPs on April 25, 2023,  and of the 19 services announced, 16 were American, two were Chinese (AliExpress \nand TikTok), and one was European (Zalando). The 19 designated VLOPs were required to be in full compliance \nby August 25, 2023, seven months earlier than all other companies,  even though VLOPs and VLOSEs face a \nsignificantly larger compliance burden.  \n \nNew Ex -Ante Regulation and Technology Sovereignty  \n \nSince 2019, the EU has promoted an aggressive, multi -pronged approach towards “technology sovereignty” as \none of the two main policy objectives.  Under this new policy umbrella, the EU agreed on a new legal framework \nfor illegal content of online intermediaries (Digital Services Act), and ‘ex ante’ rules to limit the market power of \nthe largest online platforms (Digital Markets Act), as well as mea sures on cloud services, artificial intelligence, \nand non -personal data. EU officials have stated that the purpose of digital sovereignty is to create a “new empire” \nof European industrial powerhouses to resist American rivals. These unilateral regulations  discriminate against \nUS companies and take aim at the  US digital export market.  \n \nThe recent years have already been marked by aggressive enforcement where US tech companies have been \nsubject to Europe’s highest profile competition enforcement cases, often receiving record fines unheard of in the \nrest of the world. The European Commissi on has imposed record fines and essential facility -style rules on US \ncompanies for conduct most other regulators and courts have found to be legal. The Commission has also required \nrecord repayments of tax revenues as part of its state aid cases.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nThe European Commission and the European Central Bank are continuing to drive a European payment \nsovereignty agenda that is geared at making instant payments the “new normal”, reducing reliance on International \nCard Schemes, and Europeanizing the payment v alue chain in Europe. This has been evident in the political \nsupport for the European Payment Initiative, which notably excludes non -European players from participating. \nThe finalization of the negotiations on the instant payments regulation in 2024 has al so been a step forward, with \nsome of its measures already starting to apply in January 2025. Discussions continue on the European Commission \nproposals to review the Payment Services Directive (PSD3/R), and a proposal for Financial Data Access (FIDA) \nframew ork, with the aim to improve consumer protection and competition in electronic payments as well as to \ndevelop fairer access and use of data in the EU Digital Single Market. Separately, both the Council of the EU and \nthe European Parliament continue discuss ing the regulation on a retail Digital Euro, with political skepticism over \nthe project still present. As currently envisaged, it gives extensive power to the ECB as both the issuer of the \nDigital Euro and the scheme manager while also overseeing most of t he competitors to the future digital currency. \nDespite little progress on the legislative side in Brussels, the European Central Bank has vowed to keep advancing \nacross several key elements of the digital euro project. In fact, it is currently in the “prep aration phase,” focusing \non finalizing the scheme rule book and selecting providers for developing parts of the needed infrastructure.  \n \nInternet Infrastructure Levy  \n \nThe European Commission launched a consultation exploring the possibility of requiring over -the-top providers \n“of a certain size” to bear the co st of the development of telecom infrastructure in Europe. The internet \ninfrastructure levy, supported by European telecommunications companies, would initially require six US \ncompanies to pay €20 billion annually to telecommunications operators to support infrastructure development. \nIntroducing an internet levy to subsidize EU telecommunications companies would have significant consequences \nfor the digital economy and would dir ectly discriminate against US companies who are already significantly \ninvested i n European networks and internet infrastructure. Despite strong opposition to the proposal through  \n \n 56 \nconsultation , including from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and opposition \nfrom a large group of EU Member states, the EC is pushing forward with the proposal.  \n \nEU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) Implementation  \n \nThe EU’s FSR gives  new powers to target economic distortions in the EU market caused by foreign subsidies. \nWhile the EC claims that the FSR targets subsidies from non -market economies, the FSR subject s US businesses \nto the same burde nsome and detailed reporting obligations as companies from non -market economies that unfairly \ncompete in the EU market. Any company operating in the EU market is required to disclose “financial \ncontributions” from non -EU governments (e.g., subsidies, certain fiscal inc entives, capital injections) granted up \nto three years prior to their participation in the following activities: (i) public procurement procedures where the \ntender exceeds €250M and (ii) mergers and acquisitions in which parties’ aggregate EU revenues exce ed €500M. \nIn addition, the FSR also provides the EC with an ex officio tool to investigate financial contributions on an ad \nhoc basis.  If the EC finds businesses to have benefitted from “distortive” subsidies, it could (i) disqualify them \nfrom public tend ers and M\u0026As in the EU and (ii) apply regressive measures such as subsidy repayments. Failure \nto disclose financial contributions or to comply with regressive measures may result in fines up to 10% of \ncompanies’ global revenue. Of concern, certain i ncentives that fall within the scope of the FSR that would not \nhave to be notified if granted by an EU Member States (e.g., certain audiovisual incentives and R\u0026D tax credits). \nIn addition, the EC has failed to offer any guidance on how it will operationalize the FSR’s ex officio tool; thus, \ncreating signifi cant uncertainty for businesses and opening the door for discriminatory enforcement.  \n \nPossible European Commission Proposal - Internet Tax - “Fair Share” Contributions from US Tech \n \nIn the first half of 2022, both Commissioner Breton and Executive Vice President Vestager gave their voice of \nsupport to exploring possible measures for large technology content and application providers  to potentially \ncontribute to the roll out of Europea n telecoms operators’ networks. These measures are being pushed strongly \nby European telecoms operators who claim that due to the ‘load’ placed on their network infrastructure by the \nlargest players (they point to Google, Amazon, Meta, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft) their business is becoming \nless viable and therefore posing a risk to future investments needed to meet the EU’s connectivity targets. The \nBureau of European Regulators for Electronic Communications has found “no evidence” that a direct \ncompensa tion mechanism proposed by European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association members \n“is justified given the current state of the market.”   It is vital, that during the pre -legislative phase we are now in, \nUSTR makes very clear that  the proposal i n Europe differs from Universal Reform proposals under discussion in \nthe U nited States  and any such direct financial contribution from US companies to EU companies, for the purpose \nof improving their network infrastructure, is unacceptable, irrational, and damaging.   \n \nGeographic Indications (GI)  \n \nThe EU’s system applies GI protections to an over -broad swath of food products and negatively impacts trademark \nprotection and market access for US products with generic names.  The European Union has been pursuing \nincreasingly aggressive bilateral and multilateral strategies to restrict the use of common cheese names by non -EU \nproducers, which we urge the United States to strongly oppose.   \n \nMeursing Table Tariff Codes  \n \nWe note the US comments in previous NTE s remain relevant and concerning:  “Many processed food products, \nsuch as confectionary products, baked goods, and miscellaneous food preparations, are subject to a special tariff \ncode system in the EU.  Under this system, often referred to as the Meursing table, the EU charges a tariff on each  \n \n 57 \nimported product based on the product’s content of milk protein, milk fat, starch, and sugar.  As a result, products \nthat the United States and other countries might consider equivalent for tariff classification purposes sometimes \nreceive different rates of duty in the EU depending on the mix of ingredients in each product. The difficulty of \ncalcula ting Meursing duties imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on, and creates uncertainty for, \nexporters, especially those seeking to ship new products to the  EU.”  \n \nSupplemental Protection Certificates  \n \nSPC’s are integral to the European IP system and restore effective patent term to compensate for a portion of the \ntime incurred during the testing and regulatory review period that may “make  [] the period of effective protection \nunder the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into that research.”44 It is not clear that e ffective SPC \nprotection, conferring the same legal protections as those available during the regular patent term, must be retained \nin order to ensure the ability of the system to co ntinue to meet its policy objectives.  \n \nChemicals  \n \nThe European Commission “Chemical Strategy for Sustainability” (CSS)  involve s a multi -faceted long -term \nstrateg y to revamp how chemicals are addressed within the European regulatory framework. It recognizes the EU \nchemical regulatory system as one of the most comprehensive and “protective” in the world advances  through 2024 \nan even more aggressive and precautionary regulatory framework.  \n \nWithin this broader context, USCIB members remain concerned that the European Commission, EU governments, \nand their regulatory authorities continue to introduce non -scientific, quasi -scientific or even political factors into \nregulatory policymaking. Additi onally, the implementation and the development of these regulations are \ninconsistent with the internationally agreed standards that form the basis for the WTO principles, in particular as \nembodied in the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SP S). The European Union’s actions \nfrequently lead to confusion with trading partners and form the basis for non -tariff trade barriers. The EU’s \nestablishment of regulations that lack technical justification and whose burdens of implementation are not \npropor tionate to intended consumer or environmental benefits will have serious impacts on both US producers and \nmanufacturers.  \n \nEuropean Retail Payment Strategy  \n \nThe European Commission and the European Central Bank are driving a European payment sovereignty agenda \nthat is geared at making instant payments the “new normal” and Europeanizing  the payment value chain in Europe. \nThis has been most evidenced by their support and push for the European Payment Initiative, which notably \nexcludes non -European players from participating.  \n \nDigital Services Tax  \n \nAs the OECD BEPS Pillar 1 negotiations have ground to an impasse, many of the EU Member states that do not \ncurrently have a DST are seeking to reinstate discussion of a Directive on the common system of a digital services \ntax on revenues resulting from the  provision of certain digital services and possibly on a corporate tax of a \n\"significant digital presence\". Both measures have been blocked during the Pillar 1 negotiations. As noted by the \nTax Foundation, \"About half of all European OECD countries have ei ther announced, proposed, or implemented \na DST. Because these taxes mainly impact US companies and are thus perceived as discriminatory, the United \n \n44 See EC Regulation No. 469/2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (May 6, 2009) at Re cital 4.   \n \n 58 \nStates responded to the policies with retaliatory tariff threats, urging countries to abandon unilateral measures.\" \n(link https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/digital -tax-europe -2024/ ) USCIB encourages the USTR to remain \nengaged in opposition to discriminatory taxes.  \n \nVAT: Complex VAT Registration and Compliance Requirements in Intra-EU Trade \n \nThe cost of compliance with VAT requirements when selling into the EU Single Market is higher for non -EU \nbusinesses than for EU businesses and constitutes a significant non -tariff barrier. The current EU VAT registration \nsystem is generally found to be fra gmented, complex and particularly costly for SMEs. This in effect restricts \naccess to EU trade.  \n \nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) Implementation  \n  \nInternational trade and environmental protection must be mutually supportive as nations make tough choices  \nto battle climate change, curtail pollution, and ensure a sustainable future. We must work together to align policies \nand include robust industry stakeholder engagement to help the world achieve carbon neutrality consistent with a \nrules -based multilateral trading system.  \n \nThe EU seeks  to accelerate climate  action , recognizing the potential challenge posed by carbon leakage given \nexisting asymmetries in domestic policies. However, during the first reporting period and transitional phases  of \nCBAM , companies of all sizes have raised a series of questions and concerns.  \n \nThe Commission has issued extensive  information  on CBAM that  is easily accessible on the internet for all \ninterested stakeholders. However, there continue s to be a host of questions or lack of uncertainty related to the \nimplementation of the CBAM.  We believe more dialogue focused on operational matters would provide additional \nclarity to stakeholders.   \n \nFRANCE  \n \nGovernment Procurement /Services Barriers - SecNumCloud  \n \nFrance’s national cybersecurity agency, Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (ANNSI), \nrevised its cybersecurity certification and labeling program, known as SecNumCloud, in 2022 to disadvantage —\nand effectively preclude —foreign cloud f irms from providing services to government agencies as well as 600 -\nplus firms that operate “vital” and “essential” services. France’s “Trusted Cloud Doctrine” and SecNumCloud \nrequire that cloud providers must be “immune to non -EU laws” and, per Article 19. 6 of explicitly disqualify any \ncompany that is more than 39 percent foreign owned (i.e., non -European) from certification eligibility. As a result, \nUS companies must partner with, and transfer technology and control to, a local company in order compete for \ncloud business with French public sector agencies and commercial entities considered “operators of vital \nimportance .” SecNumCloud certification is a prerequisite to compete in cloud contract tenders with European \ngovernments and critical infrastructure op erators. The EU’s international trade commitments under the WTO \nGPA and GATS agreements include the principles of non -discrimination and national treatment in terms of the \nnationality of persons, products, services, or technologies. Specifically, Article 1 9.6 of SecNumCloud appears to \nbe a clear violation of Article 3 of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, which stipulates that GPA \nsignatories “shall not treat a locally established  supplier less favorably  than another locally established  supplier \non the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership .”   The French legislature is currently contemplating an \namendment that would require that SecNumCloud requirements also apply to private entities in the healthcare \nsector.   \n \n 59 \nNational Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (SecNumCloud)  \n \nIn March 2022, France’s national cybersecurity agency (ANNSI) revised its cybersecurity certification and \nlabeling program SecNumCloud to disadvantage – and effectively preclude – foreign CSPs from providing \nservices to government agencies and 600+ organiz ations operating “vital” and “essential” services. Specifically, \nSecNumCloud and France’s ‘Trusted Cloud Doctrine’ require certified CSPs to be “immune to non -EU laws”, \nand explicitly disqualify from certification any CSP that is more than 24% foreign -owne d (i.e., non -European). \nAs a result, US CSPs must partner with and transfer technology and control to a local provider in order to provide \ncloud services to covered entities. SecNumCloud certification is a prerequisite to compete in cloud contract \ntenders with European governments and critical infrastructure operators. The EU’s international trade \ncommitments under the WTO GPA and GATS agreements include the principles of non -discrimination and \nnational treatment in terms of the nationality of persons, prod ucts, services, or technologies. Specifically, Article \n19.6 of SecNumCloud appears to be a clear violation of Article 3 of the WTO Government Procurement \nAgreement, which stipulates that GPA signatories “shall not treat a locally -established supplier less favourably \nthan another locally -established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership”.  The French \nlegislature is continues to contemplate amendments that would expand SecNumCloud requirements to private \nentities in other sectors . \n \nLaw to Prevent Foreign Interference in France  (July 25, 2024 ) \n \nThe law was i nspired by the US F oreign Agents Registration A ct, and establishes  a Foreign Influence Register , a \npublic digital register for foreign influence activities, requiring transparency from individuals and entities \n(companies, think tanks etc) acting on behalf of foreign powers outside the EU.  It establishes  a new scheme , \noperational through  2028  of algorithmic monitoring by intelligence services to detect foreign interference or \nthreats to national security. If foreign influence is found, it provides for freezing of assets.  \n \nLaw to Secure and Regulate the Digital Space  (May 21, 2024 ) \n \nFrance has enacted a new law  to secure and regulate the digital space .  Of concern are articles 31 and  32, that \nimpact  certain types of data and services (national security, health data, public safety etc), prohibiting the use of \ncloud providers that could give access to such data to foreign countries and their authorities. This is a p ush towards \nthe SecNumCloud certification . \n \nGERMANY  \n \nAbsence of an Independent and Effective Regulator  \n \nAs in prior years, Germany remains a difficult market for new entran ts. USCIB urges USTR to continue to urge \nGermany to comply with its WTO commitments.  \n \nThe absence of an independent and effective regulator continues to have a negative impact on the development \nof competition , even many years after liberalization of the market . The German Federal Network Agency, \nBNetzA, continues to be subject to inappropriate political pressure  despite continued claims to the contrary by the \nMinistry of Econom y.  \n \nAlthough the stake has been further reduced in the second quarter 2024, the German Government continues to \nhold a strong direct and indirect ownership interest of 31.9 percent in Deutsche Telekom AG (“DTAG”), the \nincumbent operator. The Federal Republic of  Germany still holds 27.8% of the shares, of which 13.97% are held  \n \n 60 \nby KfW (German state -owned investment and development bank).  Under German law, BNetzA itself is a \nsubordinated authority of the Federal Ministry of Econom y. Although the decisions of its ruling chambers cannot \nbe overruled by the Ministry, BNetzA remains bound by the Ministry’s directives.  \n \nThe absence of an independent and effective regulator has received attention from other market watchdogs and \nstill after so many years remains an unresolved issue. T he German Monopolies Commission , which is a \npermanent, independent body of experts which advises the federal government and legislative bodies in the fields \nof competition policy, competition law and regulation i n a public statement dated September 7, 2021 , addressed \nthe issue by demanding from the next German government:  \n \nIt remains necessary to sell the Federal Republic's stake in Deutsche Telekom AG of just under 32 percent. This \nshareholding gives rise to a conflict of interest, as the Federal Republic sets the regulatory framework in the \nTelecommunications Act and also influences market developments through its regulatory authority. On the other \nhand, as a shareholder represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Republic has a vested interest \nin adequate dividends and in the future profitability of Deutsch e Telekom. The sale of the Federal Republic's stake \nwould put an end to the state's problematic dual role as regulator and shareholder.  \n \nNo action has been taken since the Commission issued its recommendation .  \n \nDespite growing  criticism, representative s of the German government continue to assert that they are not seeking \nany changes in the direct and indirect state shareholdings in Deutsche Telekom AG, nor do they want to change \nthe Ministry of Economics’ technical supervision of the Federal Network Age ncy BNetzA.  BNetzA should be \nmade completely independent of instructions from the government and a clear commitment to the rules of the \nWTO should be made by selling the direct and indirect state shareholding in D eutsche Telekom.   \n \nEven the European Court of Justice ruled recently that BNetzA must become more independent from political \ninfluence.  At the heart of the ECJ recommendation is the role of BNetzA as a regulator.   \n \nThe Bonn -based authority (similar to the telecommunications sector) sets network charges for electricity and gas \non the basis of rules decided by politicians. However, in the view of the European Commission, which is \nresponsible for ensuring compliance with  EU law, the authority is not independent enough  – it should be able to \nact at its own discretion, i.e. , without being bound by political guidelines. The ECJ upheld this view in its ruling \ndated September 2, 2021 (Case C -718/18): In its decision, it calle d on Germany to grant the Federal Network \nAgency more independence. Complete independence of national regulatory authorities is necessary to ensure that \nthey act impartially and in a non -discriminatory manner towards economic operators and public bodies.  \n \nMost recently, the Administrative Court in Cologne (Germany) has declared that the auction for the auction of \nfrequencies for 5G mobile communications in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz ranges held in 2019 was unlawful. The \nCourt ruled that the procedure had been un lawfully influenced,  in particular by the Federal Ministry of Transport \nand Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) under the leadership of the then Federal Minister Scheuer. In this ruling, a \nnational court has for the first time mentioned serious concerns about BNetzA’s lack of indep endence which even \nled to unlawful decision making by BNetzA.  \n \nTherefore, market participants now joined by important voices as mentioned above continue to believe that the \ncreation of an independent and effective regulator requires the divestiture of the government’s ownership stake \nin the incumbent operator. USCIB u rges USTR to continue to urge Germany to finally take the necessary steps \nto create an independent regulator.  \n  \n \n 61 \nUSCIB urges USTR to ensure that Germany effectively and in a timely manner implement secondary legislation  \n \nFinally, the German data retention law, entered into force in of December 2015, continues to create significant \nuncertainties for US companies doing business in Germany. Despite the German Federal Administrative Court \nnow finally ruling in its decision of August 14, 2023 (File No. BVerwG 6 C 6.22) Despite the German Federal \nAdministrative Court ruling that the German law is incompatible with EU law , legal uncertainty remains in place \nespecially in the face of disagreements within the government coalition on  how to proceed with data retention and \nwhich concept should be used . USCIB urges USTR to ensure that Germany clarifies the legal uncertainty soon \nand considers reasonable timelines and thresholds before putting high sunken cost burdens and short deadlines on \nmarket participants before attempting to make up for the long dela y as a result of the court proceedings.  \n \nThe issue continues to require USTR’s attention given that the German government is now past the deadline of \nAugust 2023 to reconsider its approach to data retention following the Federal Administrative Court’s ruling. \nMore seriously, in light of upcoming elections end of September 2025, market participants remain to be concerned \nthat, with the end of the legislative term in sight, there may still be a rush to pass legislation that is heavily \ninfluenced by electoral interests and that largely disregards obj ective arguments . \n \nAs noted in previous years, market participants are seriously concerned with these issues beyond the immediate \nbusiness impact due to a) Germany’s important role in Europe and globally and b) the landmark character of \nGermany’s example, which, if left unchallenged, might open the door to other countries applying similar \nmeasures, or worse.  USCIB urges USTR to continue to monitor these developments and, if necessary, to remind \nGermany of the requirements of its “most favored nation” (MFN) and national treatm ent obligations under the \nGATS.  \n \nDrug Pricing and Reimbursement  \n \nNew innovative reimbursed drugs are freely priced for 12 months after launch. Manufacturers of new innovative \nreimbursed drugs must submit an early benefit dossier to the Federal Joint Committee (G -BA), which (following \nan initial assessment by the Institu te for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care [IQWiG]) conducts an early benefit \nassessment to evaluate the additional benefit offered by the drug versus comparators. For products with an \nadditional benefit, reimbursement price negotiations between manufact urers and the Federal Association of \nHealth Insurance Funds (GKV -Spitzenverband) ensue. A drug with no additional benefit is automatically included \nin the reference price reimbursement system: it can then be freely priced, but reimbursement is limited to t he \nreference price.  The process is so unfavorable that it has prompted some manufacturers to shelve planned launches \nfor a number of innovative drugs.  \n \nBy the end of 2016, the number of new medicines withdrawn during the course of the evaluation and negotiation \nprocedure was reported to be 29. Diabetes, cancer , and neurological drugs are most affected. Under the draft AM -\nVSG, early benefit assessment may be extended to existing drugs authorized for new indications.  \n \nFollowing implementation in April 2017 of the Pharmaceutical Care Strengthening Act , Germany imposed a price \nmoratorium on non -reference priced drugs, which was set to end at the end of this year.  Recently, it was announced \nthat the price moratorium will be extended until 2022, and as such, non -reference priced drugs must remain at the \nsame (realized) price as in August 2009 until 2022.  On Price Transparency, the draft Pharmaceutical Care \nStrengthening Act recommends that confidential discounted reimbursement prices of drugs negotiated following \nAMNOG assessments no longer remain confidential.  \n \n   \n \n 62 \nHONG KONG  \n \nData Flow Restrictions  \n \nIn 2019, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a circular that mandates financial \ninstitutions to store data in Hong Kong with locally -registered external electronic service providers (EDSP)  – a \nde facto data residency requirement – or requires the financial institution’s internationally -registered EDSP to \nsign an undertaking to provide the SFC unrestricted access to a financial institution’s data hosted with the EDSP \nas a condition for doing business. The circular  bypasses existing legal processes and provides blanket \nauthorization for the regulator to access customer records. The circular mandates EDSPs to respond to the SFC’s \nrequest for customer data in contradiction with the EDSPs’ legal obligation to their cust omer.  \n \nNational Security Law  \n \nThe national security law was promulgated in Hong Kong in June 2020. It allows the Hong Kong authorities to \nrequest message publishers, platform service providers, hosting service providers and/or network service \nproviders to remove a message deemed to con stitute an offense endangering national security; restrict or cease \naccess by any person to the message; or restrict or cease access by any person to the platform or its relevant parts.  \nThe Hong Kong authorities have reportedly demanded internet service providers to block access to websites in \nHong Kong. Website blocks are barriers to maintaining a free and open internet which is critical to digital trade.  \n \nCybersecurity of Critical Information Infrastructure Bill  \n \nAs Hong Kong seeks to  strengthen the cybersecurity of critical information infrastructure , USTR should ensure \nthat no restrictions on cross -border data flows and no data infrastructure localization mandates should be included \nas part of the new law. Any new data localization requirements will put US  companies at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis -a-vis their Chinese and Hong Kong competitors.   \n \nHUNGARY  \n \nData Localization  \n \nIn Hungary, data management rules for state and local government bodies providing essential services are \ngoverned by Act No. 50 of 2013 on the Electronic Information Security of State and Local Government Bodies \n(Act). The data managed by state and local g overnment bodies under this Act may only be processed and stored \non Hungarian territory, except where the supervisory authority authorizes the processing on the territory of another \nEEA country. Any entity not registered in Hungary handling data covered by  the Act must appoint a representative \nin Hungary.  \n \nINDIA  \n \nIt is important to keep encouraging the Indian government to support market liberalization and remove remaining \nmarket access barriers. India should be urged to continue to provide legal and regulatory policy certainty both in \nthe development of a body of clear and consistent laws and regulations, and in the transparent and equitable \napplication and enforcement of those laws and regulations.  Unfortunately, in recent years the Government of India \nhas implemented several  discriminatory  policies  related to local testing, import licenses, compulsory licenses , \ndata localization , and tariffs  that constitute significant market access barriers to US companies.   \n  \n \n 63 \nDigital Taxation  \n \nUSCIB is encouraged that the Indian government recently moved  to suspend the country’s 2 percent “equalization \nlevy” on foreign digital companies  \n \nIndia  had imposed  an “equalization levy” that include d a 2 percent tax on the sale of goods and services by non -\nIndian companies over the Internet into India. A wide range of companies are required to pay this tax, given the \nbroad definition of those in scope.  While structurally different from DSTs from European countries, the tax was \nsimilar  insofar as it discriminate d against US firms and exempting local businesses.   \n \nThe equalization lev y follows previous protectionist tax measures in India against foreign digital services.  In \n2016, the government introduced a 6 percent level on foreign digital advertising businesses  which is still in place . \nThe government also proposed the concept of “significant economic presence” in 2018, but deferred \nimplementation until there was international consensus on this question.  \n \nThe new e -commerce equalization levy was a protectionist step and a unilateral move, coming when discussions \nare underway at the OECD on permanent establishment and profit attribution. We urge USTR to remain vigilant \nto ensure the equalization levy  remains suspended.  \n \nCustoms Duties on Electronic Transmissions  \n \nIndia has been critical of the World Trade Organization’s moratorium on customs duties on electronic \ntransmissions and believes that ending the moratorium will enable the growth of domestic businesses.45 Any \nimposition of new duties on electronic transmission would be inconsistent with India’s WTO commitments and \nwould significantly impact an exporter’s ability to operate in India’s increasingly growing digital economy. USTR \nshould continue to push back on India’s opposition and work for renewal of the moratorium at the 14th WTO \nMinisterial Conference in 2026.  \n \nInformation Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules  \n \nIn February 2021, the government notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital \nMedia Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which amongst other things required service providers to appoint local officers, \nhave a local address, publish transpa rency reports , and enable users to verify themselves. Separately, for \n“publishers .” there is a requirement to adhere to a prescribed Code of Ethics, with incidental product changes to \nensure rating and classification as per prescribed guidelines and implem ent access and parental control \nmechanisms and to implement a three -tiered grievance redressal mechanism.  \n \nAmong other things, the  Rules require that a Significant Social Media Intermediary (SSMI), i.e., a social media \nintermediary having more than 5 million registered users in India, has to establish a Chief Compliance Officer, a \nNodal Contact Person, and a Resident Grievance Office r, each of which must be resident in India.  The Rules also \nrequire that a SSMI providing messaging services enable the identification of the first originator of the \ninformation, when required to do so by an India government authority . \n \n45 DEP’T FOR PROMOTION OF INDUSTRY \u0026 INTERNAL TRADE , Draft National e -Commerce Policy (2019), available at  \nhttps://dipp.gov.in/sites/default/files/DraftNational_e -commerce_Policy_23February2019.pdf [hereinafter “India National E -Commerce Strategy”] at \n10 (“By making the moratorium permanent, and with more and more products now traded digitally in the era of ad ditive manufacturing and digital \nprinting, the GATT schedule of countries will erode and will vanish ultimately. Assuming that all non  agriculture products can be traded \nelectronically, then everything will be traded at zero duty. So, the protection that is available to India, for the nascent i ndustries in the digital arena \nwill disappear at once, and that is an immensely important issue which concerns public policy makers in the developing world.”).   \n \n 64 \n \nThe Rules give raise to numerous procedural and substantive concerns. The Rules overhauled the regulatory \nlandscape for companies operating in India’s Internet services sector, imposing new requirements that require in \ndepth changes to be made within the organ izational structure of the concerned companies, which is time \nconsuming, thus affecting their ability to immediately comply. These onerous new requirements, which carry the \nthreat of personal criminal liability for non -compliance, were promulgated with  no meaningful industry \nconsultation, and with an impractical three -month timeline for compliance.  \n \nAs these  rules were imposed without final stakeholder engagement or notification, they leave US industry exposed \nto substantial compliance burdens and jeopardize the safety of personnel on the ground. The rules also have a \npotential chilling effect on future investment, and some advocates argue it will lead to over -removal and \ncensorship of legitimate content, including political speech.  \n \nProposed Amendments to E-Commerce Rules \n \nInitially released in January 2019 for consultation, the draft E -commerce Policy represents the Government of \nIndia’s official position on a host of digital economy issues. The 2019 draft was explicitly discriminatory and \ncontemplated: (1) broad -based data  localization requirements and restrictions on cross -border data flows; (2) \nexpanded grounds for forced transfer of Intellectual Property and proprietary source code; (3) preferential \ntreatment for domestic digital products and incentives for domestic data  storage in India (e.g. , provision of \ninfrastructure; incentives to domestic data center operators). The policy also introduces the notion of community \ndata as a “national resource” where countries are “custodians” over data. A revised draft of the E -Commerce \nPolicy has been in t he works ever since. Media reports have suggested the following: (i) certain categories of data \nsuch as defen se, medical records, biological records, cartographic data, and genome mapping data should not be \ntransferred outside India ; (ii) certain categories of e -commerce data should be mirrored/stored in India (with the \ngovernment/a proposed e -commerce regulator deciding the categories).  \n \nThe upcoming National E -Commerce policy aims to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting \nconsumer interests. However, i t introduces both regulatory and protectionist measures to address the challenges \nposed by the digital economy.  \n \nGeospatial Data Guidelines  \n \nIndia’s Guidelines relating to geospatial data and associated services contain elements that are discriminatory to \nforeign service providers. For instance, the guidelines provide preferential access to Indian companies to access \ngeospatial data and develop geospatial services in India by prohibiting foreign entities from creating and owning \ngeospatial data finer than a certain spatial accuracy threshold. While for eign entities can obtain a license for such \nmaps or data through an Indian entity provided it i s used only for the purpose of serving Indian users, subsequent \nreuse and resale of such maps/data is prohibited. There is also a data localization requirement for such data, which \nhas to be stored and processed on a domestic cloud or on servers physically  located in India.  \n \nRestrictions to Cloud Services  \n \nIn 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the Framework for the Adoption of Cloud \nServices by SEBI Regulated Entities to highlight the key risks and mandatory control meas ures regulatory entities \nneed to implement before adopting cloud computing.  It outlines 9 principles and requirements for REs to consider \nwhen adopting cloud computing  and was developed after consulting with market stakeholders, regulators, cloud \nservice providers, government agencies, and SEBI Advisory Committe es. REs that fall under this requirement  \n \n 65 \ninclude stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, asset management companies, qualified registrars to \nan issue and share transfer agents, and know your customer (KYC) registration agencies.  \n \nData ownership is a major aspect of compliance, so REs must fully control and possess all of their data. Due \ndiligence is also an essential principle, and REs must assess the implications, risks, and advantages of \nimplementing cloud services guided by residual risk and criticality of data and services.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nThe National Payment Council of India (NPCI) is a quasi -government agency and operates the largest domestic \npayment system in the country, including United Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay (debit and credit) cards.  In \nthe past several years, the Government of India has taken many direct and indirect actions that give preferential \ntreatment to NPCI, some of which are enumerated below and give an unfair advantage to NPCI, creating a non -\nlevel playing field for US EPS providers.  \n \nThe RBI requires  payments firms to store data solely in India and ensure that any data processed abroad be deleted \nwithin 24 hours. The payment networks have complied with the RBI directive despite the short deadlines and by \ninvesting significant capital.  The Finance Ministry’s Department of Financial Services requir es any re -carding or \nissuance of new cards by banks to be compliant  with the standards defined for the National Common Mobility \nCard (NCMC). Subsequently the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affair s (MoHUA) mandated that NPCI qSPARC \nstandards would be the NCMC standards.  \n \nRupay and NPCI are the de facto  solutions for any Government disbursement programs, known collectively as \nDirect Benefit Transfers (DBT) and are now being aggressively also pushed into the Government driven credit \nand commercial transactions keeping the international networks out of the  consideration.  \n \nData Localization Requirements  \n \nThe Government of India has taken several recent steps that are in deep conflict with global best practices on data \ngovernance and data localization, and which present severe market access barriers to US firms. For example,  of \nconcern is the approach taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a sectoral regulator, mandating all foreign \npayment system providers and foreign banks to ensure that data related to electronic payments by Indian citizens \nare stored on servers located only in Ind ia. The directive implies that non -compliance could result in imprisonment \nand penalties including cancellation of the licenses.  Since April 2021, the localization conditions are being \nenforced. A few US electronic payments networks have been put under a long embargo for non -compliance.  \n \nIndia is using data localization requirements to address concerns about security and law enforcement data access . \nThese will be counterproductive to India’s security objectives. Data localization has been shown to increase \nsecurity risks and costs by requiring storage of data in a single, centralized location making companies more \nvulnerable to natural disaster, intrusion, and surveillance.  These  requirements  also make it more difficult to \nimplement best practices in data security, including redundant or shared  storage and distributed security solutions.  \n \nMandatin g local storage of data will not facilitate access to data by law enforcement. The US and India can engage \nthrough bilateral and multilateral instruments to make data sharing work in the cloud era without resorting to data \nlocalization measures. For example, the CLOUD Act provide s a path for governments that honor baseline \nprinciples of privacy, human rights, and due process to seek bilateral agreements with the U S on law enforcement \nrequests.  Additionally, such localization requirements are counter productive and are not drivers of jobs and \neconomic development.   \n \n 66 \n \nData localization requirements are even more problematic from an economic perspective. Forced localization \nsignificantly dilutes the benefits of cloud computing and cross -border data flows, which have previously brought \ngreat benefits to India and have dri ven the development of India’s IT industry. This approach fails to address \nIndia’s economic priorities, including the government’s vision of making India a $5 trillion digital economy, \ncreating jobs, and using emerging technologies like artificial intellig ence and the Internet of Things to solve the \ncountry's pressing problems.  \n \nUltimately, forced data localization will decrease foreign direct investment, harm India’s ‘ease of doing business’ \ngoals, make it more difficult for local startups to access state -of-the-art technologies and global markets, and hurt \nIndian consumers seeki ng to access information and innovative products online. USCIB strongly urges USTR to \nrequest the removal of data localization requirements in the RBI directive, the data protection bill, the e -commerce \npolicy, the cloud computing policy, and other recent measures or proposals.  \n \nThe raft of data localization measures adopted or proposed by India are a significant concern.  They frustrate the \nability of foreign companies to operate in the Indian market, but also harm innovation, impede economic growth \nand exports, increase costs for consumers and enterprises (especially SMEs), harm competition and technology \nchoice, and under mine cybersecurity.  \n \nLocal Content Requirement  \n \nAligned with the Government of India’s continued rhetoric on self -reliance, the Public Procurement (Preference \nto Make in India), Order 2017 and subsequent revisions mandates that only Class -I suppliers (with local value \naddition \u003e50%) and Class -II supplie rs (local value addition – 20% to 50%) are eligible to bid for government \nprocurement. This is applicable to both products and services. This order poses a significant compliance challenge \nin particular to foreign software and cloud service providers (CSPs ) to demonstrate local value add. This model \ndoes not consider the investments and other contributions made by foreign CSPs that enable the Indian Tech \necosystem and their global competitiveness, such as skilling initiatives, cloud innovation centers, quan tum \ncomputing lab etc. Even if CSPs don’t directly bid for government contracts, partners need to certify their \npercentage of local content, for which they rely on their vendors’ local value addition as well. For example, where \ncloud services are a substan tial cost element in a public procurement bid, percentage of local value add from a \nCSP becomes important. Moreover, the Indian government is considering revisions to the order and increasing \nthe minimum local content requirement for Class -I suppliers to 6 0% and Class -II suppliers to 30%.  \n \nMandatory Telecom Certification Framework  \n \nIndian Telecom licensees are required to connect their networks only with telecom equipment that has been tested \nand certified under the Mandatory Testing and Certification Framework (MTCTE). The mandatory testing and \ncertification scheme is operational fo r certain IT and telecom products on parameters of safety, functionality and \npotentially security as well. The scope of this requirement was recently increased to include cloud software \n(Hypervisors), which goes beyond telecom products . \nLocal Technical Standards  \n \nThe Indian government’s think tank, NITI Aayog, launched the “Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture ” \n(DEPA) in 2021. The DEPA is a consent -based framework for individuals to securely access and share their \ninformation between businesses. By proposing a new technological architecture consisting of India -specific data \nprotection, processing, and sharing standards, the  DEPA could lead to trade restrictive standards.  \n  \n \n 67 \nNational M2M Roadmap  \n \nThe National Telecom M2M Roadmap document issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) in \nMay 2015 is a roadmap document intended to foster healthy growth of M2M. While DOT acknowledges the \nimportance of aligning with the evolving global standards and has adopted a forward -looking approach generally \nto policymaking, DOT must continue to recognize the global essence of these services  as well as the critical \nimportance of creating a policy environment that allows for flexibility and use of commercial arrangements to the \nhealthy proliferation of M2M and IoT services.  \n \nWe urge the Government of India to take a light -touch regulatory approach in devising an implementation \nframework for M2M. In addition, we urge the Government of India to keep in mind the following principles:  \n \n• Avoid restrictions on the free flow of information across borders  and does not disrupt the global nature of \nthese flows . \n• Avoid imposing any restrictions or prescribing a limited timeframe on permanent international roaming \n(as recommended by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India , “TRAI”) to provide flexibility for differing \nservice models, e.g., some SIM cards will be embedded in manufacturing devices that are stationary; some \nwill be embedded in cars -- others in unforeseen combinations. The GOI should avoid imposing any \ntechnology mandat es or timeframe related requirements and favor a flexible and a light -touch approach.  \n• Avoid prohibiting the use of foreign SIMs for permanent roaming, as this will impede the growth of M2M \nservices. Further, requiring the use of a local number will not enhance the availability of data significantly.  \nSetting a limitation on permanent roaming will have a negative impact on the ability of foreign suppliers \nof M2M services to operate in India.  This will further impede the pace of innovation in the country as \nprescribing any time limit will bring uncertainty to the investors. We understand that DoT is actively \nconsidering TRAI’s recommendation on roaming which will be a retrograde step and against the objectives \nstated in the M2M Telecom Policy Roadmap issued in 2015 which required prior consultation.  In line with \nthe National Telecom M2M Roadmap if and when any such thought process is developed, we request DoT \nto hold a prior industry wide stakeh older consultation.  \n• Avoid requiring the use of local Indian SIM for M2M, as it would not be technically and commercially \nviable to retrofit devices embedded with foreign SIMs with local SIMs. That would be a costly and lengthy \nprocess. In addition, there may be design element s associated with the SIM that would need to be \nconsidered such as proprietary nature of SIM or the design which cannot be replicated , or replacement \nmay endanger or impede SIM functionality.  \n• No specific mandate on data and server localization and no time -bound usage of global SIMs to support \npermanent M2M roaming as recommended by TRAI ; and,  \n• Avoid market access limitations.  We are also concerned that the recent TRAI recommendations to DoT \ninclude suggestions that the Indian government should identify critical services in the M2M sector and \nthat the provision of these services be restricted to be provided only by connectivity providers using \nlicensed spectrum.  Should India move to limit market access for certain services to only licensed spectrum \nusers, we urge a very narrow definition of critical services that is consistent with India’s trade o bligations \nand maintains flexibility for new and innovative services.  Any limitations on market access should be \nconducted through a thor ough stakeholder consultation. Furthermore, the recent TRAI recommendations \nalso suggest that the government should establish comprehensive guidelines for the \nmanufacturing/importing of M2M devices in India.  Any eventual policy should aim to enable consumers \nin India to choose from the best available M2M devices and not limit choice.  It would also be helpful if \nDoT clarifi es any eventual policy will alter the current custom clearance procedures and mechanisms.  \n  \n \n 68 \nUSCIB urges USTR to request that the Indian Department of Telecommunications officially continue to permit  \nthe use of foreign SIMs shall be permitted for use in permanent roaming and that they shall not be required to be \nconverted/reconfigured into an Indian Telecom Service Provider’s SIM  within 3 years as recommended by TRAI . \nWe note that the TRAI in its August 2017 Recommendation has indicated  that the Authority/Licensor shall review \nthis issue at a later date based on market and technological development s and requirements.  \n \nUSCIB further urges the USTR to encourage India to promote an international, interoperable , and uniform  policy \nframework for IoT and M2M solutions that includes permanent M2M roaming.  Many IoT and M2M solutions \nwill only reach their optimal scale if they can operate around the globe.  Monitors on airline cargo or shipping \ncontainers must be able to operate wherever their freight travels.  Automakers sell vehicles across many different \ncountries and operators drive vehicles across national borders for commerci al and personal purposes; automakers \nand customers alike need a single communications platform to support their connected vehicles.  The Indian \ngovernment should support providers of IoT and M2M devices to choose between various available options for \nnumbering and device management, rather than imposing a single, one -size alternative for all cases.  \n \nFinally, USCIB calls upon USTR to request the Indian government to review its approach to permanent M2M \nroaming and to discourage India from imposing any rules that would restrict international trade in M2M servi ces. \nInstead, USTR should encourage India to adopt approaches that enable cross border data flows, refrain from data \nlocalization requirements, remain technology neutral, enable the use of global standards  in a manner that \nfacilitates the global deployment of IoT products and services, is not detrim ental to foreign investment and \ncontinues promoting the scale and interoperability required for the deployment of M2M services.  \n \nAs other countries begin to consider reviewing their existing regulations on M2M and IoT around the world, we \nurge USTR to engage them to ensure that they adopt flexible approaches that enable the deployment of this \ninnovative new service on a global basis.   \n \nOTT Regulations  \n \nIncluding the cloud computing and VoIP papers described above, TRAI has issued several consultation papers \nseeking input on whether there is a need for regulation of Over -the-Top (OTT) providers that offer cloud, VoIP, \nand other services.  Given that many of these consultations and drafts could generate restrictive rules and market \naccess barriers for US services seeking entry to the Indian market, we welcome the TRAI’s recommendations \nreleased in September 2020 which noted that a comprehensive regulatory fr amework for OTT be looked into \nwhen more clarity emerges in international jurisdictions.  \n \nOn online curated content, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) is of the view that the industry \nself-regulation code – viz., the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) code that was signed in \nSeptember 2020 by 15 OTT platforms oper ating in India – does not meet its expectations. MIB has stated that the \nIAMAI code of ethics is not well -defined, has no  provision for prohibited content, and has a conflict of interest \non the advisory panel. We encourage USTR to work with India to adopt the IAMAI code of conduct.  \n \nMore recently, India has released draft telecom legislation that would encompass a broad range of email, cloud, \nand OTT services. The bill would require a wide range of US companies to obtain licensing requirements to \noperate in India, and would subject su ch companies to unpredictable fees, including levies of entry fees, license \nfees and registration fees. In addition, the bill contemplates a range of potentially damaging requirements from a \nsecurity and privacy perspective, including “Know Your Customer” norms for OTT services that would require \nthe identity of a person sending messages to be revealed to the user receiving the message, expansive powers for  \n \n 69 \nsurveillance and shutdown of internet services without appropriate safeguards, powers to conduct search and \nseizure for unauthorized networks or equipment, and mandated disclosure of information from encrypted services.  \n \nTelecommunications Sector Developments  \n \nWe urge the Government  of India  to examine the terms and conditions of telecom licenses / policies to bridge the \ngap between emerging technology and services and current regulations, particularly on issues affecting the \nenterprise services sector in India. In particular , we would like to highlight the need for urgent reforms in the \nfollowing areas as has been highlighted by the industry:  \n   \n• Expedited approval for Equipment Procurement from Trusted sources:  DoT to consider industry request \nto expedite the approval process and exempt the CPE/Security equipment from the equipment approval \nprocess pending from NSCS.     \n• AGR/Multiple Levy of Licensing Fees:  To consider industry requests to allow pass through of the \nAGR/licensing fee under the NLD/ILD License. We understand that the DOT has referred the matter to \nthe TRAI in January 2022.    \n \nAdvertising  \n \nCentral Consumer Protection Authority released a consultation on Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and \nNecessary Due Diligence for Endorsement of Advertisements. This will be applicable to all forms of media and \nmakes manufacturers, service providers , advertising agencies and endorsers of products responsible, to varying \ndegrees, for advertisement content and manufacturers’ claims. This will be in addition to the generic laws \napplicable to OTT.   \n \nWe encourage USTR to work with India to take into account comments received to refine these proposed \nguidelines to introduce clarity to its scope of application, reduce overlap with existing regulations and minimize \ncost to businesses.  \n \nTelecommunications Network Security  \n \nWe are concerned about India’s mandatory requirement to test certain ICT technology . The mandatory testing \nand certification scheme requires all telecom products capable of connecting the public network (directly or \nindirectly) to be tested and certified in India by the Telecommunications Engineering Center of the Ministry of \nCommunication s. The Ministry of Communications should work with industry to improve the ease of doing \nbusiness in India by eliminating this requirement.  This would reduce the number of  redundant testing and \ncertification of the products in India, and, thereby, reducing the costs of technical and/or regulatory barriers to \ntrade.  \n \nThere is no evidence that the geography of development or testing of a product corresponds with the level of \nsecurity assurance provided by the product. Thus, the government’s insistence on having products tested locally \nwill not provide greater security a ssurance. USTR should emphasize that there are longstanding internationally \naccredited/recognized laboratories conducting testing in this area, and that the location where the testing is \nperformed, in accordance with global best practice, has no bearing on  the accuracy of the test in question, as long \nas the laboratory has achieved the appropriate certification.  \n \nWe urge USTR to suggest that the Indian government to examine these issues carefully and establish close \nconsultation with industry stakeholders to find a practical and flexible approach.   \n \n 70 \n \nDefining the Revenue for Payment of License Fee  \n \nUSCIB urges India to examine the methodology it currently uses to calculate the annual license fees to ensure \nthat India’s license fee regime does not frustrate the goals of promoting competition, creating a level playing field \namong all service providers, and r educing the sales price of services to consumers. Under the current \nmethodology, license fees are based on revenues from both licensed and unlicensed activities, which makes  the \ncalculation of such fees unnecessarily burdensome. Also, the current def inition leads to double payment of license \nfees to the Indian government as it does not allow deduction of wholesale charges from retail revenues.  \n \nUSCIB applauds India’s decision to enable Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) to deduct the inputs they rely on \nto offer their service. The double assessment of licensing fees operates as a multi -stage and cumulative tax.  We \nwould request DoT to make a similar dispensation for the f acilities -based operators, such as National Long \nDistance/International Long Distance and ISP licensees who, relying on their own networks, only pay the license \nfee once .  \n \nEncryption  \n \nThe freedom of business and consumers in India to use strong encryption protects their corporate and personal \ninformation. Strong encryption also enables India’s rapidly growing IT and business processing industries to \nsecure their global clients’ confiden tial information. The Government of India should be urged to reflect the needs \nof next generation data more appropriately , IP services providers , and the considerations of their business \nenterprise customers by allowing for the robust use of encryption to protect data and privacy. USCIB opposes any \neffort to weaken or limit the effectiveness of commercial encryption technologies that are essential to modern \nbusiness.  We encourage the Government of India to work with the US and other governments to share best \npractices in this area.  \n \nCybersecurity is a true common cause, as industry shares many risks and objectives with governments, users, and \nother stakeholders. The breadth of cybersecurity threats is vast; from cyber terrorism to online safety and \nconventional cybercrimes. A key comp onent in strengthening networks against cybersecurity threats is strong \nencryption. So that businesses may employ the measures to reasonably protect information, a critical component \nof India’s updated encryption policy must include updating the permissibl e level of encryption for enterprise \nservices beyond the current 40 -bit level.  Businesses must instead be permitted to apply encryption consistent with \nindustry standard guidelines, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).   \n \nUSCIB requests USTR to urge India to recognize that it is essential that enterprise services providers be permitted \nto offer and provide network services that employ more robust encryption to allow business customers to better \nsecure customers’ networks an d communications from cyber threats.  The current encryption limitation reduces \nthe ability of business customers to apply industry -standard encryption to network services to help defend against \ncybersecurity threats, which are increasing in volume and soph istication at exponential rates.   \n \nProcedure  for Certification  of Telecommunications  Equipment  \n \nIn 2017, the Department of Telecommunications issued new, draft requirements for in -country testing and \ncertification of certain ICT equipment (Department of Telecommunication’s “Procedure for Certification of \nTelecommunications Equipment”).  Similar to other testing regimes noted in this submission, these  requirements \nrequire redundant and costly in -country testing for any company seeking to sell ICT products in India.  These new \nrequirements are separate from the Compulsory Registration Order and the 2011 T elecom License Amendments.    \n \n 71 \n \nImplementation of the Procedure for Certification of Telecommunications Equipment requires USCIB members \nto deal with three distinct testing requirements that deviate from international norms and serve as significant \nmarket access barriers: (1) Compulsory Registration Order for safety testing; (2) telecommunications security \ntesting under the 2011 Telecom License Amendmen ts; and (3) the Department of Telecommunication’s Procedure \nfor Certification of Telecommunications Equipment.   \n \nTechnical Barriers to Trade for ICT Products  \n \nSlow and unpredictable approval by Indian standards bodies: Imports of certain electronics and ICT products \nrequires certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)  and “equipment type approval” from the Wireless \nPlanning \u0026 Coordination wing of the Ministry of Communications.  The procedures for obtaining these approvals \nare massively time consuming and opaque, with undefined timelines that often produce inordinate delays.  The \nlack of transparency, predictability, and timeliness creates a significant  barrier to imports.  \n \nOnerous, India -specific standards: India has adopted or is considering country -specific product standards that \ncreate significant compliance burdens for importers and foreign manufacturers and that impede trade.  In the area \nof ICT products, for example, India requires certification under its Trusted Electronics Value Chain (TEVC) \nscheme, rather than the internationally developed Open Trusted Technology Provider Standard (OTTPS). The \ncertification and auditing proc ess under TEVC is both highly burdensome, an d risks divergence from \ninternationally developed standards.  In the area of 5G wireless telecommunications, India’s Telecommunications \nStandards Development Society has been developing its own “5Gi” standard, separate from the standard \ndeveloped by the global 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  An effort by India to make 5Gi the exclusive \nstandard in India will have a seriously negative impact on trade and investment in India’s telecommunications \nsector and related sectors.  \n \nDuplicative testing requirements: India has required that a range of telecommunications and IT products undergo \nmandatory testing and certification under its Mandatory Testing and Certification of Telecom Equipment \n(MTCTE) scheme.  The duplicative testing requirement (additional to those already administered by BIS) imposes \na significant compliance burden on importers and serves as a barrier to market access, without providing any \naddition additional benefit for consumers or users of  these products. In Septe mber 2021, India's \nTelecommunications Engineering Center published a list of products for inclusion in Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the \nMTCTE scheme. Phase 3 includes products already subject to  certification under MeitY's compulsory registration \n(CRO) scheme, resulting in unprecedented dual certification requirements that result in significant inefficiencies, \nhigher compliance costs, and delays in bringing products to the market.  \n \nTechnical Barriers to Trade, Toys  \n \nIndia implemented the Quality Control Order (QCO) for toys in 2021. Since then, children’s toys (defined as toys \nfor under 14) imported and sold into the market have to be BIS certified. The certification requires the toy \ncompanies’ (both domestic and fore ign) factories to be audited by BIS, test their products for quality by an Indian \nlab, and then receive the license for their entry and sale in the country. The entire process takes about 6 months \n(but are frequently faced with delays), depending on variou s factors like the availability of the BIS representative \nto travel to the factory location, testing by BIS labs (which could take time as the number of labs is still small \ncompared to the scale of testing required) and the final issuance of the license by  BIS. After the expiry of the \ninitial license (which is typically valid for about 1 year), the licenses need to be renewed. The renewal process \ndoes not require another factory audit, and in our recent experience, renewals of the license has been successfu lly \ngranted but for only 1 year.   \n \n 72 \n \nThe process of applying for new licenses and renewals for foreign manufacturers is manual in nature, requires \nextensive physical documentation, and processing timelines are often unpredictable (due to resource constraints \nat BIS). This process results in s ignificant compliance costs, and unpredictable lead times for the seamless entry \nof products into India. An electronic application system has been introduced to domestic manufacturers.  \n  \nAs raised in the WTO TBT Committee:  \n• The application process should be simplified with less documentation needed and electronic versions of \ndocuments should also be accepted for review. This would include extending the same online system – \nManak online (which is available to domestic manufact urers) – to foreign manufacturers to submit the \napplications. This differentiated treatment between foreign and local manufacturers is also contrary to the \nWTO’s principle of national treatment.  \n• The renewal of existing certificates is delayed and, in some cases,  not granted. Where it is granted, the \nvalidity of the renewals is 1 year. Increasing the validity of renewed licenses for more than a year would \nfree up capacity and increase efficiency in the overall system of processing applications, given that \nrenewals typically take 2-3 months and new applications take about 6 months to process.  \n• The processing of applications for Southeast Asia factories owned by the same parent company of the \nIndian entity could be more positively and expeditiously made.  \n  \nDGFT Notification No. 33/2015 -2022 is a duplicative toy safety test requirement at the point of importation.  \n \nAs raised in the WTO TBT Committee:  \n \n• Even with the BIS license under QCO in order, importers are also subject to the same set of product safety \nand quality tests (as required for obtaining the BIS license) at point of importation under DGFT \nNotification No. 33/2015 -2020. Duplicating this test  at point of importation adds significant delay and \ncosts without any impact on the assurance of safety and quality of the product. It would be advisable for \nIndia to consider the withdrawal of DGFT Notification No. 33/2015 -2020 for products that are BIS \ncertified under QCO and eliminate the duplicate tests.  \n \nTariffs  \n \nIndia's tariff regime for ICT products and inputs continues to be highly unpredictable and disruptive, with ongoing \nand new tariffs creating a challenging trade and investment environment for US companies.  \n \nSince  2014, India has systematically raised import duties on a wide range of products, aiming at further \nincentivizing domestic value addition. Through those policies,  several goods are subjected to import duties \ninconsistent with India's Schedule of commitments. For the telecom sector,  the customs notification 11/2014, \nattempted to impose a 10  percent  duty rate on all products/technologies as listed below covered under India’s \ndomestic HTS 8517.62.90 and 8517.69.90.  \n \n• Soft switches and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) equipment, namely, VoIP phones, media gateways, \ngateway controllers and session border controllers;  \n• Optical transport equipment’s, combination of one or more of Packet Optical Transport Product or Switch \n(POTP or POTS), Optical Transport Network (OTN) products, and IP Radios;  \n• Carrier Ethernet Switch, Packet Transport Node (PTN) products, Multi -protocol Label Switching -\nTransport Profile (M PLS -TP) products;   \n \n 73 \n• Multiple Input / Multiple Output (MIMO) and Long -Term Evolution (LTE) . \n \nSince then, the duty rate has been increased 20  percent  on products falling under these HTS codes.  \n \nIndia applies 20  percent  or 10  percent  duties, depending on the types of products, to products covered under  \n“machines for the reception, conversion and transmission or regeneration of voice, images or other data, including \nswitching and routing apparatus,” falling under tariff item no. 8517.62.90 of the First Schedule, which clearly \nexceeds the applicable bound rate of 0  percent  set forth in India's Schedule. There have been various \nnotifications/measures subsequently issued further imposing duties.  \n \nSince  India became a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement  in 1997 , several new technologies have \nevolved in the telecom sector to address new functionalities required. Accordingly, tariff preference commitments \nunder the ITA apply only to the original commitment and not to the new technologies evolved over the years. We \nare c oncern ed about  India’s duties on the following product categories classified under HTS 8517.62.90 : \n \n• IP phones  \n• Line Card  \n• Non-Carrier Switch (Enterprise -grade Switches)  \n• Other (such as Access Points)  \n• Security Appliance/Firewall  \n  \nRouters are currently still duty free  in India but  may not  remain so. There is also a risk that everything else in this \nsubheading currently below 20  percent  will increase to 20  percent . \n \nIn addition, the Finance Act of 2024 recommended the reclassification of printer cartridges and toner as well as a \nchange in duty rate. On or before the effective date of the Finance Act (No.2) 2024, printer cartridges and toner \nwere free of customs duty (zero duty) as “Parts” of a printer.   Under the Finance Act 2024, the existing domestic \nsubheading text will move to the more general subheading text of:  CTH 8443.99.51 and 8443.99.52 covering \n“Cartridges or toners, with print head assembly” and “Cartridges or toners, without print head assembly”, \nrespectively. As of October 1, 2024, these ink and toner cartridges will be subject to 10 percent duty under the \nFirst Schedule.  \n \nIntellectual Property  and Pharmaceuticals  \n \nUSCIB supports the Government of India’s National IPR Policy (“the policy”) for its range of objectives, from \nraising awareness on the benefits of intellectual property to strengthening the country’s legal, administrative and \nenforcement capabilities.  Overall, the National IPR Policy acknowledges the importance of IP as a driver of \neconomic growth.  \n \nWe are concerned, however, that  the policy lacks specificity with respect to inter -ministerial coordination on \nimplementation, budget allocation, and does not address some of the most important outstanding IP policy \nissues including with respect to Section 3(d)’s enhanced efficacy requi rements for pharmaceutical patents.  We \nhope that the policy will serve as a platform for continued engagement and enhanced dialogue with the Indian \ngovernment towards more concrete legislative, regulatory and related reforms to address pharmaceutical IP \nissues – for example, with respect to clarifying Section 3(d) of India’s patent law, providing for early resolution \nof patent disputes, and simplifying administrative requirements.  \n  \n \n 74 \nWe also support  efforts by the  Government of India to decriminalize copyright infringement provisions in the \nCopyright Act of 1957.  \n \nIP protections in India lag behind both developed and other developing countries.46 Removing a few key barriers \ncould transform India into a center for discovery and development of life -saving biopharmaceutical products.47  \n \nThe restart of the Trade Policy Forum IP Taskforce to elevate IP discussions between the two countries is a \nwelcomed and long overdue development. Several  loopholes in Indian IP law that undermine and devalue US \ninnovation should be addressed. These include:  \n \n• Early resolution of patent violations: India does not provide mechanisms for notification or resolution of \npatent disputes prior to marketing approval of generic products. Such mechanisms are needed to prevent \nthe marketing of patent infringing products an d resolve disputes in a timely manner.  \n• USCIB asks for mandatory registration of new drug applications in India’s centralized Sugam portal and \naccess to all companies to this portal to enable patent holders to act upon any potential infringements in a \ntimely manner  \n• Modification to the pre -grant and post -grant patent opposition system: Unlike in the United States, any \nperson may challenge a patent application in India at any time before a patent is granted. This has allowed \nparties with political, ideological, and oth er non -technical opposition to patent applications to unduly delay \nthe process by raising numerous pre -grant challenges. The Indian Government should implement an \napolitical, time -bound, outcomes -driven system for third party pre -grant patent opposition an d post -grant \nopposition on identical grounds based on substantially identical facts and evidence as pre -grant opposition \nshould also be denied.  \n• USCIB asks for amendments to the patent rules such that defined time -limit be put in place for any pre -\ngrant oppositions, with remaining oppositions converted to post -grant oppositions. This will prevent undue \ndelay in grant of IP.  \n \nIllicit Trade  \n \nIllicit trade is becoming a more substantial challenge for US companies operating in India and the region and also \nraises health and safety concerns for patients. One  concern is the increase in illicit trade crossing the border \nbetween India and Bangladesh. The challenge of counterfeit Bangladeshi pharmaceuticals can be traced to \nviolations of law, resource challenges, and the need for greater partnership on both sides of the border. We urge \nthe US government to encourage intensive training, strategic deplo yment of resources, and greater partnership \nbetween Indian and Bangladeshi authorities. In addition, authorities should take greater action against websites \nselling illicit medicines and local distributors facilitating their spread. USCIB asks the Government of India to \ntake up the matter of illegal exports of patented medicines into India with appropriate authorities in Bangladesh . \n \n46 PwC, Vision 2025: Unlocking India’s Potential for Leadership in Pharmaceutical Innovation  (Oct. 2016), p. 9.  \n47 E.

This change in tax rate affects foreign banks in particular.  In2019, corporate tax rate \ncuts were announced for domestic companies from 30  percent  to 22  percent , while the rates for branches of foreign \ncompanies remained unchanged.  This change created  a significant  disparity in tax rates, an 18  percent  difference \nin base rate and 12.3  percent  after factoring in in the Dividend Distribution Tax.  Foreign bank branches are subject \nto the same prudential regulations and the same method for computation of profits and taxable income and \ntherefore should be subject to the same tax rate.  We urge USTR to seek an end to this discriminatory tax treatment.   \n \nPrivacy and Data Protection  \n \nThe Digital Personal Protection Act of 2023 (DPDP Act) was enacted by the Indian parliament on August 11, \n2023.  As India’s first comprehensive data protection law, it aims to balance the need to process personal data for \nlawful purposes with the right of individuals to protect their data.  The law groups personal data into different \ncategories with “sensitive” and “critical” data requiring hi gher levels of protection.  The DPDPA imposes \npenalties for non -compliance ranging from INR 10,000 to INR 250 Crores , depending on the nature of t he \nviolation.  It requires certain businesses to be categorized as  \n \nImport License Regulations  \n \nComputers, Laptops, and Other Data Processing Machinery  \n \nOn August 3, 2023, India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) released Notification No. \n23/2023, imposing import restrictions on laptops, computers, and other personal electronics that fall under \nthe purview of HSN 8741. This regulation altered th e conditions for import of these electronics from “free” \nto “restricted” with immediate effect. The following day, the DGFT released Notification No. 26/2023, \ndelaying the implementation of Notification No. 23/2023 until November 1, 2023. Until that date, import \nconsignments of the affected electronics can be cleared without a License for Restricted Imports. This new \nimport licensing requirement could potentially delay and is likely to disrupt imports of in -scope \ninformation and communication technology (IC T) equipment into India. In a Stakeholder Consultation by \nthe Directorate General for Foreign Trade (DGFT) in September 2023, it was noted that Data Centers will \nbe required to obtain a license to import servers into India. In September 2023, DGFT also ver bally \nconfirmed that servers and server racks are subject to the impot authorization requirement. DGFT also \nnoted that while applying for a license, the applicant will be required to provide the manufacturing \nturnover, trading turnover, import turnover and  export turnover for the prior three years.  As part of this \nmeasure, India is also considering the institution of an annual quota on these products that may start in \n2024, which will cause supply disruptions and deny company access to ICT equipment that i s not locally \navailable.  \n \nReasons for the implementation of these regulations include national security concerns and boosting the \ndomestic production of electronics. Specifically, India has long expressed a desire to become self -reliant \n(in line with Prime Minister Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat  Abhiyan  doctrine) in the information technology \nspace, especially regarding hardware manufacturing and its current reliance on the importation of Chinese \nelectronics.  \n  \n \n 76 \nThis effort has been pushed back and recast as an “import management system.” Late September 2024, \nwe learned the measures have been pushed back another 3 months (until December 31, 2024. Industry \ncontinues to have no visibility and/or implementation guida nce. Members are concerned that the intent is \nto eventually impose quotas to force domestic production and that introducing such a quota would also \nviolate India’s WTO commitments.  \n \n Medical Equipment and Devices   \n \nIn order to regulate all medical devices, the Government of India Ministry of Health and Family Welfare \n(MoHFW) published G.S.R. 102 (E) on February 11, 2020, for regulation of said products in a phased \nmanner . Under the 2020 notification, the class C \u0026 D medical devices were to be under import liscense \n(IL) regime from October 1, 2023. There was a six -month extension granted, as a result as of April 11, \n2024, ILs are required for these medical devices. Since  April 11, 2024, when enforcement of regulations \nfor Class C \u0026 D medical devices went into effect, companies that were previously able to import certain \ntypes of refurbished medical equipment, some of which are in use in India and other countries, became \nunable to do so. This is due to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) suspending \napprovals of existing and new applications for import licenses, pending revised guidance from NITI \nAayog. The existing approach creates regulatory ambiguity. Al ong with CDSCO, the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Forest \u0026 Climate Change (MoEFCC) must also approve imported refurbished medical \nequipment. MoEFCC has continued to grant those approvals in a timely manner. Yet without \ncorresponding CDSCO approval, companies ar e unable to import their products. A clear regulatory \nframework by CDSCO for the import of refurbished medical equipment is needed. US exporters have \nraised concerns over the lack of prior stakeholder consultations, and a lack of certainty on the timeline for \na resolution. In effect, this creates an unlevel playing field for US companies and limits the choices of \nIndian healthcare institutions.  \n \nCustoms  and Wet Signatures  \n \nIndia continues with the requirement of \"wet signatures\" by authorized signatory for filing appeals at various \nappellate levels for customs litigation, duty drawback claim applications upon re -export, etc. which implies \nadministrative complexity and additi onal burden to the industry. Using wet signatures on every document can be \ntime-consuming and not conducive to ease of doing business. Using digital document management systems along \nwith electronic signatures will allow for secure and legally binding sign atures while reducing the need for physical \npaperwork.  \n \nINDONESIA  \n \nIndonesia imposes local content requirements in the telecom , pharmaceutical s, energy and other sector s that are \nnot consistent with its WTO obligations and is currently considering further such requirements. The Indonesian \nMinistry for Communications and Information Technology has two decrees, a wireless broadband decree and a \ntelecommunications decree, that place restrictive local content requirements and sourcing requirements on service \nproviders.   \n \nThe “wireless broadband decree” requires local content of 30 -50 percent in the wireless broadband sector. The \n“telecommunications decree” requires all service operators to spend 35 percent of their capital expenditures on \ndomestically manufactured equipmen t. Currently, at least 40 percent of the equipment must be locally sourced, \nbut within the next five years it is expected to increase to 50 percent. These provisions are reiterated in Article 6 \nof the 2011 decree on the use of the 2.3 GHz Radio Frequency B and (19/PER/M.KOMINFO/09/2011). These  \n \n 77 \nrestrictions do not appear consistent with Indonesia’s obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade -Related \nInvestment Measures and may also raise concerns under Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n(GATT). USCIB supports  efforts  to raise these concerns in the WTO Committee on Trade -Related Investment \nMeasures and urges USTR to continue to press Indonesia to remove these restrictions.  \n \nWTO Information Technology Agreement Commitments  \n \nIndonesia continues to contravene its WTO binding tariff commitments by charging tariffs on a range of imported \ntechnology products that are covered by Indonesia’s commitments under the Information Technology Agreement \nand should receive duty free treatmen t. Indonesia has implemented few of its ITA commitments and has sought \nto re-classify technology goods that have similar functions into dutiable HS codes that are outside ITA categories \nas a means to raise revenue, but in most cases the reclassified HS cod es are also themselves covered by Indonesia’s \nITA commitments. This practice widely affects the IT industry and negatively impacts US investors and their \nworkers. We urge USTR to continue to raise these issues with Indonesia bilaterally as well as through the WTO. \nFor example, Indonesia continues to impose duties on printers and related parts, data center and networking \nequipment (e.g., routers, switches, servers and server racks, optical modules, and optical cables), and other ICT \nproducts, such as solid -state drives, that are covered by the ITA.  This practice widely affects the IT industry and \nnegatively impacts US investors and their workers. We urge USTR to continue to raise these issues with Indonesia \nbilaterally as well as through the WTO.  \n \nTrade Balancing  \n \nIn 2022, Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade issued Regulation No. 25 (Neraca Komoditas, or “Commodity Balance” \nregulation) that allows the government to determine whether it  will approve permits for the importation of specific \ngoods, including certain consumer electronics. The government’s decision is based on an assessment of whether \nimports of a particular product  exceed exports of that product – where such a trade balance is negative, the \ngovernment may reject import permits. The mechanism creates a de facto import quota on these products.  \n \nThis proposal remains a real concern for  US companies from various sectors . The regulation was initially adopted \nonly with respect to agricultural products but  was subsequently expanded  to cover all ranges  of consumer and \ntechnology products (footwear, printers, mobile phones).  Separate from the fact that imposition of import quotas \nor other restrictions on these products would breach Indonesia’s WTO commitments, the uncertainly caused by \nthis regulation be ing in place is massively disruptive on its own.  Indonesia’s regime for administering import \nrestraints is also highly opaque  – they ask for “import plans” in advance, then issue import licenses based on those  \nplans (and the licensing requirement is itself WTO noncompliant) .  \n \nProcurement  \n \nThe Government of Indonesia issued Presidential Regulation Number 12 of 2021 concerning Government \nProcurement of Goods/Services (“PR 12/2021 ”) requiring goods and services offered for government \nprocurement to contain a total Domestic Component Level (Tingkat Komponen Dalam Negeri – TKDN) value \nplus Company Benefit Weight (Bobot Manfaat Perusaaan  – BMP) value of at least 40 percent. Imported products \nmay be procured provided that: (i) the goods are unable to be produced domestically, or (ii) the domestic \nproduction volume does not meet the needs.  \n \n   \n \n 78 \nNo foreign ICT company was able to meet the 40  percent  TKDN requirement. The regulation states further that \ncentral and regional government agencies shall procure goods and services from local micro, small and medium \nenterprises (MSMEs) or cooperatives. Government entities must devote at least 40 percent of t heir procurement \nbudgets to buying goods and services from MSMEs or cooperatives. Bigger companies are encouraged to form \npartnerships with local MSMEs or cooperatives to improve their capacity.  \n \nFDI Cap  \n \nCurrent  regulations impose a cap (ranging from 49 -65 percent) on foreign ownership for telecommunication \nnetwork and service providers. These foreign ownership caps present significant and often insurmountable \nbarriers for US businesses seeking to enter the Indonesian market from an operational and economic perspective.  \nService providers are unable to establish operational control, protect their brand, and deliver services in Indonesia \nthat are seamlessly integrated in the service providers global network o fferings.  The service providers also become \na horizontal competitor of the local telecom operator provider, further eroding the value of the investment.  USCIB \nrequests that USTR encourage Indonesia to remove this provision and allow foreign companies to offer services \nwith any legally operating telecom entity they find suitable.  \n \nE-Commerce Barriers  \n \nIndonesia’s GR80/2019 on Electronic Commerce (followed by the Trade Minister Regulation No. 50/2020) \nrequires any e -commerce provider passing a set of thresholds (i.e. , more than 1000 transactions or more than 1000 \ndelivery packages in 1 year) to set up or appoint a local trade representative to act on behalf of the foreign entity. \nThe local trade representative office is then required to handle consumer protection, prom otion of domestic \nproducts, and dispute resolution locally. This requirement effectively forces US businesses to establish a local \npresence without a business need which also triggers unintentional tax consequences. To strengthen consumer \nprotection, Indon esia should follow international best practices and consider alternative measures to ensure \nconsumer protection without forcing a local presence for digital products and services.  \n \nIndonesia’s Government Regulation No. 80/2019 (GR80) on E -Commerce draws a clear distinction between \ndomestic and foreign e -commerce business actors and prohibits personal data from being sent offshore unless \notherwise approved by the Ministry of Trade thr ough a list of countries which can store Indonesian e -commerce \ndata. This effectively requires e -commerce business actors to locally reside personal data for e -commerce \ncustomers. Trade Regulation 50/2020 (TR50) on E -Commerce, an implementing regulation of  GR80, also \nrequires e -commerce providers with more than 1,000 domestic transactions annually to appoint local \nrepresentatives, promote domestic products on their platform, and share corporate statistical data with the \ngovernment. Both GR80 and TR50 pose d e facto data localization measures and local content requirements, which \nincrease overhead costs for foreign entities and create undue market barriers.  \n \nRegulations on Subsea Cable Corridors  \n \nThe Minister of Fisheries and Marine Affairs mandates  that all subsea cables in Indonesian waters need to follow \n14 prescribed routes and to have 4 pre -determined main landing points in Manado, Kupang, Papua , and Batam. \nThis is required despite the fact that more than half of existing cables are located out of these prescribed corridors, \nand there is limited business case to follow such routes and landing points. This restricts the ability of US cloud \nand infrastructure services providers  to determine the best business case for such landings and tilts the playing \nfield in favor of domestic players.  \n \n   \n \n 79 \nFurther , subsea cable permits require a series of licenses from several Ministries such as Environment, ICT, \nTransport, and Investment. The requirement from ICT Ministry specifically asks for (1) foreign operators to \npartner with a local network operator, (2) the lo cal partner to be part of the consortium, (3) a minimum of 5  percent  \nstake by the local partner, and (4) obligation to land in Indonesia. Such local rent -seeking requirements are \nsignificant market barriers for US providers to establish their bus iness operations in Indonesia.  \n \nRegulation on Private Electronic Systems Providers  \n \nThe ICT Ministry regulations on private electronic systems providers (ESP) requires f oreign and local ESPs  to \nregister with the government and appoint a local point of contact to share access to data and systems to the \ngovernment for supervisory and law enforcement purposes upon request. ESPs are required to comply with very \nstrict 24 -hour turnaround time for regular content removal requests and 4 hours for urgent removal requests. ESPs \nare also expected to provide the Indonesian government with access to d ata and systems for “supervisory and law \nenforcement purposes” within 5 calendar days upon request. Failure to meet these requirements could result in \nfines and/or product blockage. The broad and vague definitions mean that in theory many US services suppl iers \nwould be entirely in scope. The lack of clear definitions also could be potentially abused since a court order is not \nrequired for data access requests by the government.  \n \nRestrictions on Cross -Border Data Flows  \n \nUS firms have lost  and will continue to lose business in Indonesia due to the ambiguity in the data localization \nrequirements for  Public Scope ESPs. There is also a Ministry of Communications and Informatics Circular Letter \nwhich requires all Ministries to obtain clearance from the Ministry for any IT procurement or expenditure to \nensure maximum utilization of the National Government  Data Center, a challenge for cloud adoption by public \nagencies and a barrier to US cloud services providers from servicing th e Indonesian public sector market.  \n \nWhile GR 71 /201948 made  progress towards reforming Indonesia’ data localization policy and further digital \ntrade, these reforms risk being undermined by other existing policies that are incongruent with the GR 71 umbrella \nregulation.49 For example, data localization policies remain in place for banking and financial sectors despite the \npossibility of Private Scope ESPs to store and process data offshore under GR 71.  Further, GR 71 establishes an \ninteragency committee to set up and oversee the exception for Public Scope ESPs to store and process data \noffshore.  Industry reports concerns  with the limited progress on the finalization of the GR 71 implementing \nregulations, which creates business uncertainty and increased compliance risks.  \n \nRestrictions on Imports Under $100  \n \nOn September 27, 2023,  the Ministry of Trade (“MOT”) issued Regulation No. 31/2023 (“Reg 2023”), which \nprohibits foreign merchants from selling any goods valued below $100 to Indonesian customers via online \nmarketplaces and includes several other discriminatory requirements tha t will restrict imports and foreign \ninvestment in Indonesia. For example, the regulation requires foreign e -commerce platforms to receive a permit \nfrom the M OTin order to conduct business activities in Indonesia and mandates that plat forms that meet certain \ncriteria appoint a locally based representative.  \n \n \n \n48 “Communications \u0026 Informatics Ministerial Regulation on the Governance of Electronic Systems Providers for Private Scope.”  \n49 Indonesia: New Regulation on Electronic System and Transactions , BAKER MCKENZIE  (Oct. 28, 2019, \nhttps://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/insight/publications/2019/10/new -regulation -electronic -system -and-transactions   \n \n 80 \nAdditionally, it prohibits companies with a marketplace business model from acting as manufacturers  and selling \ntheir own branded products. Regulation 2023  appears to violate Indonesia’s international trade commitments, \nincluding under the WTO, and will directly affect US exports and the ability of US companies to operate in the \ncountry.  \n \nImport Restrictions - Survey Report Requirement  \n \nThe Ministry of Trade (“MOT”) Regulation No. 87/2015 (“Reg 2015”) applies to imports of goods classified in \nspecific HS codes including servers. The importer is required to appoint a company accredited by the Indonesian \nGovernment (known as the “Surveyor”)  to inspect its shipment in the origin prior to Customs clearance. The \nSurvey Report ( SR) requirement was initially enforced by Indonesian Customs (“Customs”), until MOT \nRegulation No. 51/2020 (“Reg 2020”) introduced a post -entry SR inspection process admi nistered by the \nDirectorate General of Consumer Protection and Trade Compliance of MOT, effective on August 28, 2020. Reg \n2015 was repealed and replaced by MOT Regulation No. 20/2021 (“Reg 2021”) effective on November 19, 2021 , \nto introduce new HS codes requiring SR. The product scope covers imports including servers, cooling equipment, \nhard disk drives, network interface cards and battery back -up units. The SR can cost up to US$1,600 per shipment \nand significantly increase the supply chain costs. Although both Reg 2015 and Reg 2021 allow capital goods to \nbe imported without SR if an exemption letter from the MOT is obtained, there has been limited transparency and \ntimeline provided for applying and issuing such exemption.  \n \nLocal Content Requirements: Hardware, Software, and Public Procurement  \n \nIndonesia’s Ministry of Industry issued regulation No.22/2020 (IR22) on the Calculation of Local Content \nRequirements (LCR) for Electronics and Telematics, with a government target to achieve 35% import substitution \nby 2025. IR22 provides specific and exte nsive requirements for manufacturing and development for both digital \nand non -digital physical products. The policy will have an additional administrative burden to physical ICT \nproducts that are needed for ICT companies to operate in Indonesia. There are also indications that the Indonesian \ngovernment may also introduce an importation threshold for ICT equipment. The government has also signaled \nintention to build on this LCR requirement and add similar LCRs for software and applications, which would \nimpac t companies that provide services over the internet, including cloud services. In particular, the Ministry of \nICT indicated that the revision of Government Regulation no. 71 2019 will include the LCR requirement for the \ndata center industry. In addition to  that, Presidential Instruction Number 2 Year 2022 requires government \nagencies to plan, allocate, and realize at least 40% of the national budget for goods/services to utilize MSMEs \nand Cooperative products from domestic production.  \n \nFinancial Services Data Localization  \n \nThe Bank of Indonesia still requires core/important financial transactions to be processed domestically. The \nFinancial Services Authority (OJK) has incrementally allowed some electronic processing systems to be based \noffshore for banking services, insuranc e services, multi -financing services, and lending based technology, but the \npolicy remains highly restrictive and burdensome for global companies trying to operate within Indonesia.  \n \nLocalization under E -Commerce Regulations  \n \nIndonesia’s Government Regulation No. 80/2019 (GR80) on E -Commerce draws a clear distinction between \ndomestic and foreign e -commerce business actors and  prohibits personal data from being sent offshore unless \notherwise approved by the Ministry of Trade through a list of countries which can store Indonesian e -commerce \ndata. This effectively requires e -commerce business actors to locally reside personal dat a for e -commerce  \n \n 81 \ncustomers. Trade Regulation 50/2020 (TR50) on E -Commerce, an implementing regulation of GR80, also \nrequires e -commerce providers with more than 1,000 domestic transactions annually to appoint local \nrepresentatives, promote domestic products on their platfo rm, and share corporate statistical data with the \ngovernment. Both GR80 and TR50 pose de facto  data localization measures and local content requirements, which \nincrease overhead costs for foreign entities and create undue market barriers.  \n \nImport Duty Collection on Electronic Transmission of Digital Goods  \n \nIn 2018, the MOF issued Regulation 17/2018, which established five HS lines at the 8 -digit level (with import \nduty rates currently set at zero percent) in Indonesia’s domestic tariff provisions (i.e., Chapter 98 or 99) for \nsoftware and other digital products transmitted electronically, including applications, software, video, and audio  \n(“intangible goods”) . In December 2022, the Indonesian Minister of Finance (MOF) issued Regulation No. \n190/PMK.04/2022 (\"MOF Regulation 190\"), which came into force in Januar y 2023, introducing the new import \ndeclaration procedure for intangible goods. This measure effectively established a customs administrative regime \nthat would enable Indonesia to start collecting duties on intangible goods and would result in significant \ncompliance costs and administrative burdens for businesses of all sizes operating in Indonesia. Imposition of any \nduties on digital products under this regulation would raise serious concerns regarding Indonesia’s longstanding \nWTO commitment, renewed on a m ultilateral basis in March  2024 , not to impose duties on electronic \ntransmissions. In addition, using a tariff schedule for the application of such duties on non -physical products raises \nfundamental questions and challenges related to the harmonized tariff system, the role of customs au thorities in \nthe digital space, and the determination of country of origin for electronic transmissions. If implemented on a \nmandatory basis, these customs duties would be levied on the same electronically supplied services ( ESS) that are \nsubject to a VAT in Indonesia.   \n \nUSTR and other US government agencies should continue to push back on the government of Indonesia including \nat the WTO Committee on Trade Facilitation regarding its measures and enforcement via post -clearance audit \n(yet to be implemented) .  US CIB strongly supports no customs duties and/or customs formalities should be \napplied to inta ngible goods.   \n \nElectronic Transaction Tax (ETT)  \n \nLaw 2/2020, Indonesia introduced a series of changes to its tax code, including an expansion of the definition of \npermanent establishment for purposes of Indonesia’s corporate income tax and a new electronic transaction tax \n(ETT) that targets cross -border transactions where tax treaties prohibit Indonesia from taxing corporate income \nfrom the transaction. The ETT blatantly discriminates against foreign companies as it only applies to non -\nIndonesian operators. Its efforts to deem foreign companies with SEP ( significant economic presence) as \npermanent establishments undermine s the traditional definition of a permanent establishment and creates a \nsignificant barrier to cross -border trade. MOF would need to issue additional legal measures for these new taxes \nto go into effect. Such proposals are based on an unprincipled and unsup ported distinction between digital and \nnon-digital companies.  \n \nData Localization  \n \nMinistry of ICT has announced plans to revise the Government Regulation no.71 2019 to include provisions that \nwill require, for ‘public security purposes’, certain types of data, e.g., civil registration, immigration, health, or \nfinancial data, to be proce ssed and stored within Indonesia. We expect the revisions to be passed before the new \nadministration takes office on 20 October 2024.   \n \n 82 \n \nRestrictions to Cloud Services  \n \nAccording to a regulatory review by the Asia Cloud Computing Association (ACCA), Indonesia’s regulatory \nframework is the least conducive for the adoption of public cloud technology in the financial services industry. \nThe biggest gaps are in the areas of da ta localization, the requirement to seek prior regulatory approval, and the \nlack of differentiation in the materiality of workloads.  \n \nFirst, Indonesia’s financial institutions are still blocked from using offshore data centers. Bank Indonesia – the \ncountry’s central bank – still requires payment transactions to be processed domestically.  The Financial Services \nAuthority (OJK) has incrementally allowed some electronic systems to be processed offshore in the banking and \ninsurance sector, but this has not been permitted in sectors including multi -financing and lending -based \ntechnology.  Industry reports these rules are motivated in part by re gulators' lack of trust in multilateral law \nenforcement systems.  \n \nSecond, the OJK requires financial institutions to seek its approval 2 to 3 months before moving workloads to the \npublic cloud. For instance, Regulation No. 38/POJK.03/2016 requires commercial banks planning to operate an \nelectronic system outside Indonesi a to seek approval from the OJK 3 months before the arrangement starts. In \naddition, financial institutions that plan to outsource the operation of their data centers or disaster recovery centers \nmust notify the OJK at least 2 months before the arrangement  starts.  \n \nThird, Regulation No. 9/POJK.03/2016 only allows commercial banks to outsource “support work” ( i.e., activities \nthat are low risk, do not require high banking competency and skills qualification, and do not directly relate to \noperational decision -making). These workloads that can be outsourced are all subject to the same regulatory \nrequirements, with no  differentiation in terms of materiality, unlike in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and \nSingapore.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nBank Indonesia (BI) issued its 2030 Payment System Blueprint (BSPI 2030), a continuation of the Indonesia \nPayment Systems Blueprint (IPS) 2025. BSPI 2030's vision and mission remain similar to IPS 2025, although its \nfocus shifts from growing to protecting the ecosystem, with heavy emphasis on risk and security from its 21 \ndeliverables. Restrictions that were presented in implementing regulations to the IPS 2025, however, persist in \nthe BSPI 2030, with measures mandating initiation, authorization, clearing a nd settlement of transactions to take \nplace locally. While 100% foreign ownership of US EPS companies is grandfathered, BI regulations of 23/6/2021, \n23/7/2021, and PADG 24/7/2022 all reiterate BI's authority to expand the domestic processing mandate to credit \nand e -commerce, which are currently still allowed to be processed offshore.  \n \nThe inability for U S EPS companies to access data from transactions presents substantial challenges to \ninvestment and innovation which are beneficial to improving and securing the ecosystem. This is \ncounterintuitive to the objectives of the BSPI 2030 which aims to improve fr aud detection systems and security \nof transactions as digitization has significantly increased volumes of electronic payments.  \n \nDomestic Processing Requirements  \n \nThe implementing regulation for Payment System Providers and payment Infrastructure Providers ( PBI SP ) \nrequires that all domestic transactions be processed onshore end -end (initiation -authorization -clearing and \nsettlement). The regulation includes a provision that allows for offshore processing subject to approval from BI.  \n \n 83 \nAs per the NPG regulation, currently domestic debit transactions must be processed onshore and routed via the \nNPG. Cross -border and domestic credit transactions remain routed via the international networks and processed \noffshore for now.  \n \nRisk-Based Self-Assessment for Product Approvals  \n \nPBI SP introduces a risk -based approach for product approvals. BI categorizes three levels of risk when assessing \ncompanies’ request for approval (Low, Medium, and High) - Low requires notification to BI, while medium and \nhigh requires approval from BI.  \n \nPricing  \n \nThe regulation also gives authority to the regulator to broadly determine pricing and fees, including determining \nnetwork membership fees.  \n \nReporting Requirements and Integrated Data Hub \n \nPJP and PIP are required to share data and/or information related to payment system via periodic and incidental \nreporting to BI. BI may also require other parties who work with PJP and PIP to share their data and/or information \nrelated to information when necessary. The regulation also outlines provisions for real -time capture of data \nthrough a data infrastructure organized by BI or integrated payments interface (yet to be developed).  \n \nLicensing  \n \nPBI SP introduces new definitions for payment services operators : the PJP definition includes the following \nactivities: provision of source of fund information, payment initiation and/ or acquiring services, administration \nof source of fund, and remittances services ; the PIP definition includes the following activities  --- clearing and \nfinal settlement. The International Payment Companies have been classified as PIP and many are undergoing \nconversion of their license. PJP and PIP will further be categorized  into three classifications depending on their \nscale and possible impact on the financial system. BI may impose further requirements depending on this \ncategorization, which includes requirements on capital injection, risk management, and information system  \nsecurity. PJP and PIP will be assessed based on the size of their operations, interconnectedness, complexity , and \nsubstitutability. These categories are: Systemic Payment System Operator, Critical Payment System Operator, \nand General Payment System Operat or.  \n \nForeign Digital Platform/Over -the-Top Local Registration  \n \nThe Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (KOMINFO) requires  all foreign electronic \nsystem operators (ESO) serving Indonesian customers to register locally.50 KOMINFO requires substantial \npaperwork to meet this requirement such as translation of the company’s deed of establishment and legalization \nby the Indonesian consulate. The Policy comes with penalties of blocking ESOs that are unable to register.  \n \n  \n \n50 Regulation No . 5/2020 and No. 10/2021   \n \n 84 \nLaw on Food  \n \nIndonesia Law on Food (“the Law”)  imposes  additional restrictions on the use of trademarked brand names, \npackaging, and symbols, and educational, promotional, and marketing activities for pediatric nutrition products \nfor older infants and young children.  The restrictions raise WTO concerns :  \n \n• Restrict s the use of trademarks, including by restricting the size of master brands; prohibiting the use of \ntrademarked brand names, icons , and mascots; and requiring a different look and feel for background designs, \nicons, and lay -outs for pediatric nutrition products.   \n• Prohibit s marketing and promotional activities for pediatric nutrition and dairy foods products producers by \nexpanding the Law to cover any activities by manufacturers and distributors of such products that “directly \nor indirectly” promote the use of pediatric nutr ition products through the marketing, promotion, packaging, \nand branding of non -covered products for toddlers and young children.   \n• Prohibit s the labelling  or promotion of any pediatric nutrition products in such a way as to promote designated \nproducts directly or indirectly , including activities “to promote or create an association with a designated \nproduct.”  Thus, marketing with respect to non -designated commercial child nutrition or children’s products \ncould trigger penalties if it somehow creates an “association” with products covered under the Law ; and,  \n• Prohibit s educational activities relating to use and feeding, e.g. , demonstrations of how to safely mix and \nprepare infant formula.   \n \nTaxation  \n \nThrough these regulations, Indonesia has taken steps on taxation that significantly deviate from global norms, \nbilateral tax treaties, and WTO commitments.  These steps include requirements that compel foreign services to \ncreate a permanent establishment in order to do business in Indonesia.  For example, Article 4 of the regulation \ndescribed above require s providers to create a local entity or permanent establishment, as well as undergo a \nrigorous process of registration, including first with the IT regulato r (BRTI) and then with BKPM in order to \nestablish a business entity.  This process require s significant resources from online service providers, many of \nwhich are small companies that lack the necessary legal and technical resources to comply with such processes  \nand could have significant tax consequences that conflict with OECD multilateral principles.  Furthermore, this \nrequirement likely violate s Indonesia’s WTO commitments to allow computer and other services to be provided \non a cross -border basis. USCIB urges USTR to classify these disproportionate taxation measures as market access \nbarriers.  \n \nUSCIB encourages USTR to encourage Indonesia to adopt approaches that enable cross border data flows, refrain \nfrom data localization requirements, remain technology neutral, and enable the use of global standards  in a manner \nthat supports an international, interoperable policy framework for the digital economy and that promotes foreign \ninvestment and continues promoting the scale and interoperability required for the digital economy.  \n \nMedia and Entertainment barriers  \n \nIndonesia maintains a variety of barriers in its media and entertainment sectors, significantly curtailing the growth \npotential of this sector and limiting the legal entertainment options of its citizens.  Indonesia’s film law technically \nimposes a 60  percent  screen quota for Indonesian films – a quota so impractically high that it would cripple \nIndonesia movie theater sector if it was ever enforced.  Other policies seek to limit the import of and market for \nforeign films – e.g., a prohibition on dubbing impo rted films into local languages, a local replication requirement \nthat has not been enforced since it is unnecessary and impractical.    \n \n 85 \n \nTariffs  \n \nIn August 2024, members shared that Indonesia has imposed safeguards (i.e., textile import duties) to curb \nimporters from China among other countries. The safeguard tariffs are said to impact 124 countries with the intent \nof protecting local industry from the flood of cheaper goods coming in mostly from China.  The “safeguard” \nduties were to take effect August 9 and are valid for 3 years. Information indicates that the “safeguards” apply to \nfive types of fabrics imported from 124, and countries like China, Hong Kong, and South Korea face the \n“safeguards” on their entire fabrics range.  \n \nTechnical Barriers to Trade, Toy s \n \nIndonesian  National Standardization (SNI) regulations were revised under Ministerial Regulation No. 45 of 2022 \nconcerning Industrial Standardization (Permenperin 45/2022). Sectoral implementing regulations, including one \nfor toys, to support the implementation of th e new regulation is underway. Inability to comply with the SNI \nregulation for toys will prevent importation of our products into the country.  \n \nAs raised at the  WTO TBT Committee:  \n• A sufficient public consultation period for the implementing regulation would help enable a stronger \nimplementation of the new regulations.   \n• The revision of SNI regulation should also provide incentives for business to comply by streamlining \nprocedures, rather than over complicating the process which by the way could increase illegal smuggling \nof toys.  \n• We welcome a whole set of options on where to place the QR code and the SNI mark (i.e. leaflets, primary \nor secondary packaging)  \n• We believe that sampling location should be conducted in a location that does not disrupt the production \nprocess, considering the complexity of the toy supply chain. The Government could consider more \nefficient alternatives to ensure full traceability.  \n \nIRELAND  \n \nScreening of Third Country  Transactions  Act \n \nThe landscape for foreign direct investment (FDI) into Ireland will change significantly by the Screening of Third \nCountry Transactions Act , which introduces an investment screening mechanism in Ireland for the first time.  \nUSCIB urges USTR to monitor the implementation of this  Act to ensure it is applied in a fair, non -discriminatory \nmanner that does not disadvantage US companies. The Act could have significant impact on eventual corporate \ntransactions in Ireland due to the low financial threshold and the w ide range of sectors covered.  Potential impacts \ninclude greater uncertainty for investment decisions in Ireland and potential delays in completing transactions. It \nis hoped that greater clarity will emerge on the parameters of the Bill as it progresses th rough the legislative \nprocess  \n \n   \n \n 86 \nITALY  \n \nEx-ante Regulation on Digital Platforms  \n \nThe Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) has reformed competition  law to tackle more effectively \nanticompetitive conducts by digital platforms.  \n \nFirst, the ICA  introduce d a presumption of economic dependence in the commercial relationships of third -party \nbusiness users with digital platforms that offer an intermediation service, where these platforms play a determining \nrole in reaching end users and suppliers, including as a result of network effects and data accumulation. As this is \na rebuttable pre sumption, digital platforms have the opportunity to demonstrate that this relationship of economic \ndependence does not exist. Second, the ICA introduce d new legislation, based on Germany’s 10 th amendment to \nits competition law, to designate certain companies as “ undertakings of primary importance for competition in \nmore than one market ”. These companies would be prohibited from pursuing certain conduct, unless they can \ndemonstrate that it is objectively justified. Prohibited conduct listed in the proposed amendment includes: (i) self -\npreferencing; (ii) strategically using data to erect barriers to entry; (iii) providing third party business users with \ninsufficient information on their performance on the platform; and (iv) making the provision or quality of a service \nconditional upon data transfer. Failure to comply with these rules could  lead the ICA to impose behavioral or \nstructural remedies.  \n \nAudiovisual Services Directive Implementation  \n \nItaly’s implementation of the  EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (“AVMS -D”) imposes  a significant \nincrease in the mandatory investment quotas in local productions endangering international and local investments.  \nIn 2025 Italy will have the highest mandatory investment quota in the whole of the EU.  \n \nItalian legislation imposes an excessive and unfair economic burden on telecommunications carriers in the form \nof annual taxes to be paid to the national authorities  \n \n• License taxes: Annual fixed fees have to be paid to the Ministry. These fees are substantially higher than \nsimilar fees in neighboring European countries. For the exploitation of a public telecoms network with \nnational coverage 111,000 euros, and for the p rovision of fixed telephony services 66,500 euros (Annex \n10 Code on telecoms). As these are fixed amounts, the tax is the same for the largest carriers and for \nmedium size carriers.  \n• Annual telecom tax. An annual tax has to be paid to the communications regulator, AGCOM, for the \nsupervision of the telecommunications markets. In 2024 this tax was set at 1.14 per thousand of annual \nrevenue.  \n• An extra tax has been introduced in 2024 by AGCOM to be paid by telecom carriers for the provision of \naccess to internet services (ISPs). This tax has to be paid for the supervision of intermediary services under \nthe Digital Service Act. For 2024, the tax was set as 0.125 per thousand of annual revenue.  \n \nJAPAN  \n \nTelecommunications  \n \nHandset Pricing: A particularly problematic exception relates to inventory rules. Specifically, if 24 months have \npassed since the last procurement of a device, a carrier/reseller may discount any unsold devices by 50 percent. \nHowever, for devices no longe r in production, a 50 percent discount is permitted after only 12 months since the  \n \n 87 \nlast procurement and the discount goes up to as much as 80 percent after 24 months. These exceptions to the \ndiscount restriction reward Japanese manufacturers, who tend to produce an abundance of cheaper, limited -life \ndevices, and  harm foreign companies, including US manufacturers, who create higher quality devices that retain \ntheir functionality and value over time. Even though the amended rule under the TBA has been periodically \nreviewed, substantial evaluation, particularly from the perspective of US man ufacturers has not been duly \nconsidered. Also, now that the low -priced plans of carrier service contracts have been introduced in the market and \nthe stated objective of the government has been  achieved, it is essential to leave the rest to market competition. \nThe United States continues to push for rules that will enable a level playing field for device manufacturers, \nincrease customer choice, encourage innovation, and allow retailers to have g reater control over their businesses.  \n \nTransparency and Due Process: US  industry is concerned that the Japanese government does not engage in open \nand timely stakeholder consultation and policy analysis.   \n \nThe United States continue to promote a  fair and transparent telecommunications rulemaking process in Japan, and \nthat US companies are afforded  opportunities to meaningfully participate in the rulemaking process.  \n \nRestrictions on Cross -Border Data flows and Data and Infrastructure Localization Mandates  \n \nThe Japanese Ministry of Communications (MIC) expanded the application of its telecommunications law to \nforeign services. These changes are expected to oblige foreign over -the-top (OTT) services using third -party \nfacilities (potentially including search, d igital ads, and other services that intermediate two -party \ncommunications) to (1) assign a local representative to notify and register as a service provider, and (2) observe \nobligations under its Telecommunications Business Act (TBA).  \n \nThe MIC is considering changes to its privacy guidelines under the secrecy of communications obligations under \nthe TBA.  MICs concerns are especially about cross -web, device tracking in digital ads. MIC has high interest in \nthe e-privacy regulation in the EU  and is discussing whether to have a Japanese version of the e -privacy regulation.  \n \nMarket -Based Platform Regulation  \n \nIn 2020,  METI enacted the Act on Improvement of Transparency and Fairness in Trading on Specified Digital \nPlatforms, in collaboration with the JFTC and the Digital Market Competition Headquarter (DMCH), which \nincludes requirements of information disclosure, volunta ry measures and reporting as well as strengthening a \nwatchdog function by the JFTC. The DMCH and JFTC have  also monitored abuse of superior bargaining position \non digital platforms and digital advertising and published the reports in July 2020. We are concerned that the \nregulation on digital platforms tilt s the level playing field of competition as it currently designates regulated \nbusinesses only based on the size of sales in business and does not pay attention to the characteristics of platform \nbusiness or the multi -sided nature of the business and dynamic ally evolving competitive landscape ignoring new \nbusinesses enter the market constantly.  \n \nThe Japanese Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA) established a new online consumer protection law “Act on the \nProtection of the Interests of Consumers Using Transaction Digital Platforms” in 2021. The aim of this law is to \nmandate platforms to perform certain ob ligations to facilitate resolution of disputes between merchants and \nconsumers. As a key impact, digital platforms are obligated to disclose information about merchants if requested \nby consumers.  \n \n   \n \n 88 \nRevisions to the Copyright Act  \n \nRevisions to the Copyright Act were introduced  in 2020  to crack down on leech websites and expand the scope \nof illegal downloading. This is in response to the damage to the Japanese manga (comic book) and entertainment \nindustries by pirate sites which typically operate on servers located in jurisdictions lack ing sufficient copyright \nprotection. Although the 2020 amendment makes it illegal to download anything other than music or videos, \ndownloads that cause only minor damage to the copyright owner (e .g., screenshots), are exempted.  The revisions \nto expand the definition of illegal downloading took effect in 2021.  \n \nKENYA  \n \nLocal Equity Ownership in ICT Firms and Data Localization  \n \nThe Kenyan government ICT Policy promotes  “equity participation ,”51 stipulating that only firms with 30 percent \nlocal ownership are licensed to provide ICT services. The Policy also stipulates  data localization mandates for \n“Kenyan data (to) remain in Kenya .” The 2020 Data Protection Law gave the ICT  Minister the power to mandate \ndata localization. The Office of the Data Commissioner issued  regulations  that require  data processed for the \npurpose of “actualizing a public good” shall be processed in a server and data center based in Kenya. This  include s \n(but not limited to) data related to civic registration and national identificatio n systems; primary and secondary \neducation; elections; health; electronic payments and public revenue administration.  \n \nSuch data localization mandates are a barrier to cross -border digital trade, and the forced local equity ownership \nrequirement limits market access opportunities for US companies operating in Kenya.  \n \nDigital Taxation  \n \nIn 2020, three tax laws were implemented. First, a 20  percent  withholding tax on ‘marketing, sales promotion and \nadvertising services’ provided by non -resident persons. Second, 1.5  percent  digital service tax on income from \nservices derived from or accruing in Kenya through a digital marketplace. Third, changing the VAT liability of \nexported services from zero -rated to exempt, so that the services provided by the local entity to overseas en tities \nwould no longer be classified as services for export and the local entity would no longer claim VAT refunds on \nits costs for those services.   \n \nSignificant Economic Presence Tax  \n \nUSCIB notes the tragic riots and loss of life in Kenya during the summer of 2024 that were associated with anti -\ntax demonstrations regarding the 2024 Finance Bill. That bill has been withdrawn but USCIB notes that Kenya \nmay still be seeking to implement a unilateral Significant Economic Presence Tax (SEP) on gross profits from \nservices carried out over a digital marketplace. As the US Government pursues a trade initiative with Kenya, a \nwork stream on this tax should be opened. Kenya has not joined the OECD/ G20 on unilateral DSTs but is among \na group of nations working in the United Nations on taxation of cross border services.  \n \n  \n \n51 See Publication of the National Formation Communication and Technology Policy Guidelines, 2020 , BOWMANS LAW (Sept. 1, 2020), \nhttps://www.bowmanslaw.com/insights/technology -media -and-telecommunications/publication -of-the-national -information -communication -and-\ntechnology -policy -guidelines -2020/.   \n \n 89 \nData Localization  \n \nThe Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act of 2018, and the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Regulations of \n2024, impose data localization and reporting obligations on providers of “Critical Information Infrastructure” \n(e.g., CSPs) with respect to defined categ ories of data. Operators of ‘Critical Information Infrastructure’ are \nrequired to establish a local Cybersecurity Operations Centre to monitor and report compliance to the \nCommunications Authority.  \n \nREPUBLIC of KOREA  \n \nNetwork Management for Value -Added Telecommunications Services Providers   \n \nKorea  amended  in 2020 regulations under the Telecommunications Business , imposing  impractical obligations on \nforeign services, and certain provisions may conflict with Korea’s trade commitments to the United States.  \n \nThe rules subject predominantly US Internet services to disproportionate levels of risk and responsibility \nregarding network quality management outside their practical control.  The rules inappropriately shift the burden \nfor several responsibilities pertaining to network management to “value -added telecommunications service \nproviders” (VTSPs), even though they lack the technical or information capabilities to control end -to-end de livery \nof the content in South Korea.  Internet service providers (ISPs) who con trol the network infrastructure and \nmanagement should remain the most adept to primarily control service reliability.  These changes could also lead  \nto unbalanced bargaining positions resulting in discriminatory or anti -competitive behavior by ISPs to the \ndetriment of VTSPs, which could lead to demands for increased usage fees or other contractual conditions.  \n \nNetwork Fee Legislation   \n \nKorea  imposes  ‘network use fee’ payments by content providers, ostensibly  to help fund the costs of extending \nand adding capacity to broadband networks. Korea  require s content providers to enter into paid contracts with \nInternet service providers for the content demanded by ISPs’ customers. This damage s the interests of US digital \nservices providers and Korean consumers in several respects, as local ISP s control what content reaches end users \nand US content providers have no alternative routes to reach th ese end users. It also distorts incentives and could \nlead to discriminatory treatment of content providers who have not paid the fee. Finally, it  discourage s content \nproviders from investing in moving content closer to end users in Korea.  Several parts appear to conflict with \nKorea’s trade commitments under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement.    \n \nGovernment Procurement/Services Barriers – Cloud Services  \n \nDespite its ICT leadership status globally, Korea maintains a hallmark discriminatory policy in the cloud \ncomputing service industry to block US cloud service providers (CSPs) from participating in government \nprocurement. The Cloud Security Assurance Program (CSAP) is administered by the Korea Internet \u0026 Security \nAgency (KISA) under the supervision of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT). CSAP h as been in place since \n2016, acting as a pre -condition to participate in all cloud -related public procurement bi ds.  \n \nCSAP is built upon the data localization principle in its design, by requiring CSPs to physically separate the \nserver, network, security equipment, operational personnel, access control, etc. from general cloud systems and \nto place their computing faciliti es within the national borders.  As a result, US CSPs are unable to access the \npublic procurement market despite being certified to the highest security and privacy standards globally and \nequipped with state -of-art technical capacity.   \n \n 90 \n \nWhile Korea took a positive step in January 2023 to revamp the CSAP into three tiers -- High, Moderate and Low, \nthe reform was limited in effect. Even though the physical separation rule for the cloud information network was \nlifted for the Low -tier segment , US CSPs are not able to qualify for Low -tier certification status, let alone in the \nModerate and High tiers. A set of local technical standards -based requirements remain unchanged throughout the \nthree tiers, specifically concerning the Korea -developed ve rsion of the Common Criterial (CC) certification and \nKorea’s standalone encryption module known as the Korea Cryptographic Module Validation Program (K -\nCMVP). Furthermore, the physical separation rule is still required for the Moderate and High tiers.  \n \nCSAP does not comply with Korea’s international trade commitments including the WTO Government \nProcurement Agreement (GPA), the government procurement chapter of the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, \nand the WTO’s Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBT). Given Korea’s participation in the Indo -Pacific \nEconomic Framework (IPEF) and other digital trade agreements of global scale, it is also noteworthy that CSAP \nis also in  conflict with a number of mainstream digital trade rules, including on cross -border dat a flows, \nprohibitions of data localization, and safeguards against the forced use of local encryption modules.  \n \nLocation -Based Data Restrictions  \n \nKorea’s restrictions on the export of location -based data have led to a competitive disadvantage for international \nsuppliers seeking to incorporate such data into services offered from outside of Korea. For example, foreign -based \nsuppliers of interactive s ervices incorporating location -based functions, such as traffic updates and navigation \ndirections, cannot fully compete against their Korean rivals because locally  based competitors typically are not \ndependent on foreign data processing centers and do not need to export location -based data. Korea is the only \nsignificant market in the world that maintains such restrictions on the export of location -based data. While there \nis no general legal prohibition on exporting location -based data, exporting such data r equires a license.  \n \nTo date, Korea has never approved a license to export cartographic or other location -based data, despite numerous \napplications by foreign suppliers. US stakeholders have reported that Korean officials, citing security concerns, \nare linking such approval to  a separate issue: a requirement to blur certain integrated satellite imagery of Korea, \nwhich is readily viewable on other global mapping sites based outside of Korea. Korean officials have expressed \nan interest in limiting the global availability of high -resolution commercial satellite imagery of Korea  but have \nno ready means of enforcing such a policy since most imagery is produced and distributed from outside of Korea. \nIt is unclear how limiting such availability through specific services (e.g., online mapping) of a particular supplier \naddresses the ge neral concern, since high -resolution imagery, including for Korea, is widely available as a stand -\nalone commercial product (and is often available free of charge), and offered by over a dozen different suppl iers.  \n \nData Privacy Laws  \n \nKorean Government  updated three data privacy laws  – the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), the Act on \nthe Promotion of the Use of the Information Network and Information Protection (Network Act) for ICT sector  \nand the Credit Information Use and Protection Act (Credit Information Act)  – for financial  sector to streamline \nprivacy rules and promote the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) as a central privacy authority. \nThe PIPC and relevant government agencies are preparing amendments to the enforcement decrees and the \nnecessary guidelines . We welcome efforts to consolidate data privacy laws and the establishment of a central, \nindependent privacy authority and encourage USTR to engage the Korean government on data privacy to ensure \nan interop erable system and data flows.  \n \n   \n \n 91 \nOpen Legal Data  \n \nThe lack of publicly available case law data is an obstacle to legal technology innovation and accessibility to \nlaw.  Korea currently ranks behind other jurisdictions (Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong) in the region in terms of \npublicized laws.52  According to Open Net Korea53, 5% of Supreme Court decisions and 0.05% of lower court \ndecisions are available at Korean Law Information Centre. Another site, managed by Supreme Court, makes case \ndecisions after 2013 available for criminal cases, and after 2015 for civil cases. Using this site, users can see a \nportion of a case, not the entire ruling. In order to view a case, the user must pay KRW 1,000, whilst not being sure \nif this case selected is the correct case. Access to lower court decisions is a cumbersome process  in which a single \ndocument can be retrieved for a fee through an interface with limited navigation capability.   As a result, access to \ncase data within the legal industry is lopsided, new legal technology such as visualization tools, machine learning, \nand predictive analytics cannot be developed, and there is very limited transparency to the broader public.   Open \ncase data would facilitate competition and fairness within the legal industry, facilitate trade with US businesses, \nand contribute to the rule of law goal of accessibility.  \n \nMedia and Entertainment  \n \nKorea maintains regulatory restrictions on local advertising and local language dubbing for retransmitted foreign \nchannels  and prohibits foreign retransmitted channels from carrying ads for the Korean market  as well as local \ncontent requirements on video streaming over terrestrial waves, cables , and satellites.  These provisions \nunnecessarily interfere with foreign access to Korea’s television market.   \n \nChemicals  \n \nThe Republic of Korea’s implementation of its Act on Registration and Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction \nof Chemical Substances (AREC), which is more trade restrictive than necessary, remains concerning.  Korea’s \nongoing efforts to amend AREC could create uncertainty for those exporting and importing chemical products \nand substances into Korea. Of particular concern is the lack of clarity and guidance from the Ministry of \nEnvironment and the Ministry of Emp loyment and Labor regarding the amendments.  \n \nCompletion of AREC’s implementation, before introducing modifications to the act, would provide the \ngovernment with sufficient data on types of registration and levels of compliance that would provide a basis for \ndetermining the need for amending AREC.  \n \nThe Republic of Korea should  accept Quantitative Structure -Activity Relationship (QSAR) models under its \nAREC amendments. Consistent with global practice, it is critical to provide a QSAR as part of a Weight of \nEvidence (WoE) approach for registration, regardless of the tonnage band,  for regulatory efficiency and for \nfulfilling AREC’s principle of minimizing animal testing (as specified in Article 14 of the Act).  \n \nThe US government should  continue to ask the Republic of Korea for information on its implementation of AREC \nand urge the Republic of Korea to respond to comments from interested parties.  \n \n  \n \n52 World Justice Project.

These  challenges,  coupled  with ongoing  issues  related  to the \navailability  of patent  protections  and patent  enforcement,  create  ongoing  challenges  for US companies  in Korea.  \nWe urge USTR  to continue  to use all available  tools  under  KORUS  and other  mechanisms  to resolve  these  \nlongstanding  concerns.  \n \nMALAYSIA  \n \nMedia and Entertainment Services  \n \nMalaysia imposes limits on foreign investment in a variety of media and entertainment sectors, limiting capital \ninflows and business opportunities in these sectors.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nIn 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia reversed a policy that would have only allowed a single operator i.e. , local \nnetwork PayNet (partially owned by Bank Negara Malaysia) to process all domestic credit transfer transactions. \nThis enable d US providers to compete on a level playing field, in alignment with Malaysia ’s WTO GATS \ncommitments. However, payment providers must  obtain approval from BNM , and these are subject to meeting \nconditions such as safeguards to protect and access data located offshore, enabling inter operability , and reducing \nfragmentation of multiple providers and pricing transparency.  \n \nData Protection  \n \nUSTR should continue to support helping Malaysia devise a data breach notification regime does not create \nonerous obligations and is proportional in scope to the breach will help strike the right balance between consumer \nprotection and establish unnecessary impediments to digital trade.  \n \nMALTA  \n \nData Mirroring and Hosting Requirements  \n \nMalta’s gaming regulations, enforced by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), require gaming operators to mirror \ncritical data – including financial transactions and player activity – on servers physically located within the \ncountry. The MGA claims this is req uired to access real -time data for audits, regulatory supervision and \ncompliance checks. US companies are required to submit detailed documentation regarding server locations, \nreplication processes and data transmission protocols. The replicated data must be continuously accessible to the \nMGA, making it costly for non -EU companies to become compliant. Moreover, operators using US cloud services \nmust demonstrate that data stored outside national borders is mirrored in Malta, adding another layer of \noperational complexity for US companies.  \n \n   \n \n 93 \nMEXICO  \n  \nTelecommunications  \n \nTelecommunications reform has brought about new investments and improved services and reduced prices for \nconsumers in Mexico.  However, these developments are threatened by the still very high participation of the \npreponderant economic agent in the telecommunications sector ...Accordingly, it is necessary to maintain and \nreinforce the asymmetric measures to the preponderant economic agent to promote effective competition \nconditions in the sector, allow the development of competitors and provide more and bette r services to consumers.  \nOne of the main barriers for the competition in Mexico is the  high cost of spectrum imposed by the Mexican \ngovernment , the preponderant operators set forth bureaucratic processes that produce delays, extra costs , and less \ncompetitive scenario for new operators.  USCIB request s USTR to engage Mexico to ensure it continues to \nfaithfully implement the 2013 Telecom reforms in promoting competition in the marketplace.  \n \nMexico’s Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) has a conformity assessment procedure for the field of \ntelecommunication and broadcasting (IFT -012-2019) that requires industry to share test reports that potentially \ncontain confidential business information with regard to ICT products.  In addition, these procedures require \nquadruple the number of samples for certification of potentially high -cost equipment and no longer allow the \ntransfer of conformity certifications to distributors.  \n \nAs a result of this regulation , it is not possible to certify and, consequently, to import, used, second -hand, rebuilt, \nor reconditioned ICT products. Certification for this type of products already exists for various NOMs under the \npowers of the Ministry of Economy, so there is a potential contradiction between the mandate of the telecom ’s \nregulator and the existing criteria for evaluating the conformity of the Ministry of Economy. Article 5.1.2 of TBT.  \nFurthermore, the procedures do not specify which NOMs should be used to assess the conformity of the Internet \nof Things, such as connected devices that operate with Wi -Fi and Bluetooth.   \n \nDevelopments in Mexico related to energy efficiency and product safety of IT products likely violate the technical \nbarriers to trade (TBT) provisions of the USMCA (Art. 11.6) in which Mexico committed to accept foreign \nconformity assessment results.  Mexico is regulating the energy efficiency of products through a variety of \nduplicative and in some instances conflicting regulations, including the Energy Transition Law (ETL), the \nsubsequent Regulation of the ETL, official standards for specific products , and country -specific tests and labels \nthat impose additional costs and burdens on manufacturers. Mexican Metrology law, in concert with specific \nMexican standards (NOMs), mandates unique and excessive annual testing requirements. For most countries, \nindustry t ests external power supplies once and only re -tests a product if it has been modified. Mexico’s proposed \nNOM -029 deviates from this regionally and internationally accepted practice and imposes significant burdens on \nindustry.  \n \nIndustry eagerly awaits publication of the final product safety standard NOM -019-SE-2020 (Information \ntechnology equipment and related apparatus, and office equipment ). Meanwhile, the Mexican Standards Agency \n(DGN) will not update an equivalency arrangement under which it recognized test reports to US and Canadian \nproduct safety standards. As a result of equivalency becoming invalid (once the updated NOM 019 is published \nand already the case for NOM 001), numerous products require in -country testing and cer tification to Mexico’s \nown product safety standards. Acceptance of international certifications and test reports under international \ncertification schemes in lieu of local testing and certification would mitigate expected bottlenecks and increased \ncosts an d delays at Mexico’s local labs. Mexico’s refusal to accept international accredited test lab reports means \nthat the transition time for NOM 019 is even more important. It is expected that DGN will allow only six months \nof transition time, which is, in eff ect, only three months for industry to test and certify products because labs  \n \n 94 \ntypically take at least three months to adapt to a new standard. Acceptance of international test reports that meet \nthe standard’s requirements and a one -year transition time for new products would address these concerns.  \n \nNew Measure: A modification to the technical regulation IFT -011-2017 part 2, which mandates VoLTE \nfunctionality in smartphones, entered into force in August 2021. This modification to the technical regulation was \nnot notified to the WTO nor was it included  in the 2020 Annual Work Programs 2021 of the telecommunications \nregulations as required by Article 11.3 (Incorporation of the TBT Agreement) and Article 11.7 (Transparency) of \nUSMCA. USTR should note the need to properly notify changes to technical requir ements to not only allow \nappropriate notice and comment, but also to provide sufficient time for manufacturers to accommodate them. That \nlead time may be a year or more.  \n \nMexico’s Commission  Federal d’Electricidad (CFE) is the government agency responsible for building and \noperating many of Mexico’s government -owned communications networks. CFE is a covered entity under \nMexico’s Government Procurement Chapter obligations, and yet, CFE is abro gating its USMCA commitments \nby not giving adequate notice of public tenders, not providing enough time for suppliers to respond, and not using \ntechnology -neutral specifications. We urge USTR to reengage Mexico on its government procurem ent practices \nso that US exporters of secure Internet technologies can compete on a level playing field in the Mexican \ngovernment procurement market.  \n \nTechnical Barriers to Trade  \n \nThe Secretary of Economy has published a project that modifies the General Rules and Criteria on Foreign Trade, \nspecifically number 10 of Annex 2.4.1, which considers the elimination of the exceptions for standards for electric \nand electronic safety, telec ommunications , and energy efficiency. This change applies even for products that are \nnot destined for commercialization. This change creates a trade barrier, as it will require the certificates to comply \nwith the NOM even when the products are new and are being imported for the process of testing and certification, \nor for service parts that are never sold separately. This change will affect market entry and consumer service.  \n \nSpectrum Fees \n \nAccording to a paper by the Center for Strategic \u0026 International Studies, Mexico’s high spectrum fees prevent \nthe telecommunications sector from having enough competition, increasing broadband coverage, and attracting \ninvestment.  Study by GSMA shows that if spectrum costs in Mexico were aligned with global spectrum costs 5 \nmore million Mexicans would have 4G coverage and data downloads would be 30% faster .54 Moreover, Mexico \nhas one of the most expensive spectrum costs, hindering the digital transformation i n the country.  It is crucial that \nthe Mexican government take steps, including spectrum fee reform, to promote competition in the \ntelecommunications market for the benefit of US exporters, Mexican consumers as well as to fulfill its obligations \nunder USMCA.  \n \nFunctional and Legal Separation of Telmex  \n \nTelmex was required to propose plans for its division into three components divided between two companies: (1) \na legally separate New Local Access Company (separate brand, locations, management, business practices, etc.) \nholding local loop, dedicated link,  and other passive infrastructure assets, and (2a) a Telmex Wholesale Services \nDivision responsible for providing wholesale services with the remaining Telmex assets, which will be owned by \n \n54 GSMA, El impacto de los precios del espectro en México, agosto 2022. Disponible en https: //www.gsma.com/latinamerica/es/resources/el -\nimpacto -de-los-precios -del-espectro -en-mexico/   \n \n 95 \nthe same company and (2b) a Telmex Retail Services Division composed of the remaining Telmex assets, \nresponsible for providing retail services.  Once complete, the wholesale assets (i.e., components 1 and 2a above) \nwill be required to provide access to their assets or services on a non -discriminatory (equivalence of inputs) basis \nto both internal and external clients.  \n \nOn March 31, 2018, IFT released the public version of the order establishing the definitive conditions to \nrestructure Telmex as in the following two years.  Both the New Local Access Company and the Telmex \nWholesale Services Division will be obliged to provide quarterly compliance reports; separate management \nteams; the New Local Access Company must have an independent board of directors, with a majority being  \nindependent; separate office locations; separate trademarks; separate systems for customers; and se parate \nemployee bases (no co -employment). It´s important to ensure the full implementation of functional separation .  \n \nUSCIB request that USTR continue to encourage Mexico to continue enforcing its policies to promote \ncompetition in the telecommunications market as set forth in the 2013 Constitutional Reforms.  \n \nDigital  Taxation  \n \nMexico institutes an enforcement mechanism, or “kill switch,” “kill switch,”  against non -resident entities that do \nnot comply with the application of the VAT, and Income Tax retentions on non -resident supplies of digital \nservices to Mexican consumers. The regulation empowers the tax authority to work with the telecom regulator to \nnon-resident Internet platforms, removing them from accessibility to Mexican users. Implementation of this \nblocking could fragment the Mexican Internet and lead to technical proble ms that will likely impact third parties. \nLikewise, there is a high probability that  this provision could violate USMCA Articles 15.3 of National Treatment \nfor Services and Service Suppliers; Article 15.6: Local Presence; Article 18.3: Access to and Use of Public \nTelecommunications Networks or Services; Article 19.10(a): Principles on Acce ss to and Use of the Internet for \nDigital Trade; and most importantly Articles 17.17 and 19.11 regarding Free flow of data across borders.  \n \nBarriers to Access Energy  \n \nMexican energy policymakers continue to create hurdles for companies seeking to connect to the electricity grid \nand purchase clean and reliable energy. These hurdles include directing energy consumers to purchase energy \nfrom the state -owned utility, Federa l Electricity Commission (CFE), and receiving disproportionate transmission \ninfrastructure requests as part of the process to connect to the grid with the National Center for Energy Control \n(CENACE). Many of the infrastructure requests are actual recognize d obligations of the Mexican State, that have \nsimply not been met. This takes place as the government continues to block all possibilities to pursue off -grid and \nprivate generation. As a result, US companies are unable to adequately source their energy needs in Mexico and \nhence see their clean energy targets compromised.  The United States has already requested dispute settlement \nconsultations with Mexico under the USMCA.  \n \nBarriers for Cloud in Financial Services  \n \nMexico continues to enforce 2021 regulation which requires electronic payment fund institutions to maintain a \nbusiness continuity plan in the case of disaster recovery that relies on either 1) a multi -cloud approach with at \nleast two cloud service provider s from two different jurisdictions, or 2) an on -premise data center in country that \ndoesn't depend on the primary (foreign) cloud provider. The approvals process run by the National Banking and \nSecurities Commission (CNBV) that is required for financial se rvices companies to use cloud services is resource \nintensive and is discriminatory towards foreign cloud providers, whereas existing local on -premise data centers \nneed to complete a shorter notification process. This de facto data localization requirement is in addition to an  \n \n 96 \nalready complex and time -consuming process that electronic payment fund institutions, face in order to gain \nregulatory approval to use offshore cloud infrastructure whereas in country infrastructure enjoys a more expedited \nprocess.  \n \nThe United States has raised concerns with the Mexican government that the requirements relating to use of cloud \nservice suppliers by electronic payment fund institutions have a negative competitive impact on the business of \nUS service suppliers.  \n \nTax ID Registration Affecting  US SMEs  \n \nIn 2020, Mexico passed legislation requiring US businesses that store inventory in Mexico to register for a local \ntax ID with the Tax Administration Service (SAT) and file monthly tax reports. While this process alone is not \nnovel, the process to obtain this tax ID, known as a Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC), is extremely \ncomplicated and costly. This process alone has become the primary barrier for US small and medium -sized \nenterprises (SMEs) that seek to sell their products to Mexican consumers an d businesses.  \n \nTo receive an RFC, US businesses are required to have a local Mexican address and a local Mexican legal \nrepresentative that shares 50% of the company’s tax liability, as well as pay income tax on all income generated \nin Mexico. The registration process is slow and bureaucratic , and involves 1) apostilling of documentation in the \nUS, 2) translating all documentation to Spanish by a certified translator, 3) legalizing documentation with a \nMexican Notary, 4) obtaining a SAT appointment (which can take one to f our months due to limited availability), \nand 5) registering the RFC in SAT’s offices. All of these steps are offline and in -person and can take over five \nmonths, costing over $5,000, in addition to the costs of complying with income tax obligations.  \n \nTrade Facilitation and Border Issues  \n \nUS exporters continue to face significant challenges at the US -Mexico border. The Government of Mexico has \nnot fully complied with the letter or spirit of its US-Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) customs obligations, \nand instead is moving to erect new customs barriers that harm the ability of US small businesses to benefit from \nthe agreement. Specifically, U S exporters are experiencing a significant increase in inspections and competing \nrequests for information from multiple agencies at the same time in order  to clear customs. SAT’s customs \nautomation interface has also repeatedly failed, including after recent changes were abruptly made to tariff levels, \nwhich has further increased border crossing times. US  companies have also experienced an increase in security \nincidents in northern Mexico near the border that have endangered employees and business operations.  \n \nDe Minimis  \n \nThe government has begun exploring modifying/ eliminating de minimis, along with increasing the global  rate \n(Tasa Global) to fight undervaluation of produc ts entering the country . While it’s a mid -term strategy, the \nmodification would greatly increase the cost for SMEs to export to Mexico.    \n \nTemporary Tariff Increases  \n \nIn an August 2023 presidential decree, Mexico imposed temporary 5 -25% tariff rate increases on various \ncategories of imports. The rate changes cover a broad range of products - including metals, textiles, chemicals, \noil, soap, paper, electronics, and furni ture - and were imposed without prior public notice or opportunity for \ninterested parties to comment. In addition to imposing the rate increases, the August 2023 decree also suspends \npreviously  planned tariff rate reductions. In sum, the tariff rate change s increase the cost of importing into Mexico  \n \n 97 \nwith little adjustment time for importers. The decree states these changes are needed to stabilize domestic industry, \neliminate distortions in trade,  and sets a general expiration date of July 31, 2025 , (with certain exceptions).  \n \nFull implementation of Mexico’s commitments in the USMCA’s Custom Administration and Trade Facilitation \nChapter, including those related to expediting the release of goods, transparency in customs procedures, \ncommunicating with traders, the use of informat ion technology, and the adoption and maintenance of a single \nwindow, would address these concerns . \n \nImport Ban on Products  Intended  for Inhalation  without Combustion  and Electronic Cigarettes Devices  \n \nMexico has proposed to enact prohibitions on heated tobacco products, vapour products containing nicotine, and \nelectronic cigarette devices. Mexico had previously granted duty free access for these products under the US-\nMexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA).  \n \nSome  18 Bills of Law were tabled to amend the Constitution, one of which would ban the import, export, selling \nand distribution of products intended for inhalation without combustion, including:  \n \n• heated tobacco products (HTP) classified under subheading 2404.11  \n• vapour products containing nicotine classified under subheading 2404.12; and  \n• electronic cigarettes and similar personal electric vaporising devices classified under subheading 8543.40  \n \nThese goods we previously in HS2017 subheadings 2403.99, 3824.90, and 8543.70, respectively.  While market \naccess for free trade agreements is not formally updated with each iteration of the HS, USCIB continues to \nadvocate for such measures to ensure that market access is not lost as new versions of the Harmonized System \nNomenclature (HS) enter into force.  \n \nThe proposed ban on products intended for inhalation without combustion will undermine the value of the \nUSMCA by limiting access for US  companies in the Mexican market. Further, the import ban would create serious \nunintended consequences by limiting opportunities for legitimate businesses and simultaneously creating \nadvantages for illegal operators often connected to organized crime groups  that are expected to continue providing \nillegal products.  \n \nConstitutional Reforms on Independent Regulatory Bodies  \n \nOn August 26 , 2024 , the Constitutional Commission of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies approved a proposal \nto amend the constitution and eliminate the autonomy of antitrust regulators –the Federal Economic Competition \nCommission (COFECE) and the Federal Telecommunications Inst itute (IFT) —as well as other independent \nregulatory bodies. The draft resolution still needs to be approved by Congress, signed by the President, and \napproved by the majority of State Legislatures. If enacted, COFECE’s functions would be transferred to the  \nSecretariat of Economy, and the IFT’s functions to the Secretariat of Infrastructure, Communications, and \nTransport. Given the ruling party's supermajority in both legislative chambers and local legislative bodies, and \nthe express support of the reform fr om President -elect Claudia Sheinbaum, approval of the proposal appears \nlikely. However, the process will take time. The bill’s debate and potential approval could take place shortly after \nthe swearing in of the new Congress on 09/01 or in October after Pre sident -elect Sheinbaum takes office, but the \ntimeline remains tentative and could shift to 2025 as the Congress is reviewing 19 other proposed constitutional \nreforms. Key points of the reform include:  \n  \n \n 98 \n• Centralization of Authority : The President would gain direct power over preventing, investigating, and \npunishing monopolies, anti -competitive practices, and market inefficiencies.  \n• Loss of Watchdog Independence : COFECE and IFT would effectively be dissolved, with their current \nfunctions centralized under executive branch control.  \n• Merging of Investigative and Adjudicatory Powers : The separation between the investigative and decision -\nmaking bodies would be eliminated, allowing the same entity that conducts investigations to also render \nfinal judgments.  \n• Judicial Oversight : Decisions by the new antitrust authority could still be challenged through \nconstitutional appeals and reviewed by specialized judges.  \n \nNOMs for Safety, EMC, Telecommunications and RF  \n \nOfficial Mexican Standards ( Normas Oficiales Mexicanas , or NOMs ) for Safety, EMC, Telecommunications, and \nRF are both duplicative of, and divergent from global regulations. Relevant NOMs include NOM -001, NOM -\n003, NOM -016, and NOM -019. Each of these NOMs requires product testing. While some of these NOMs have \nequivalenc y agreements recognizing test reports for equivalent standards in the US and Canada, some NOMs will \nrequire testing to the NOM standard itself or lack an equivalency agreement altogether. This  results in the need \nfor redundant testing to NOM standards, increasing the cost and barriers for importing ICT goods into Mexico. \nFor example, equipment that has yet to demonstrate compliance with NOM -001 will need to be tested to the latest \nversion of th is standard unless and until an equivalency agreement is reached and reciprocity clause is accepted \nbetween the U S, Canadian, and Mexican governments. Where an existing CB report can be used, NOM \ncertification will generally take 4 -5 weeks after an applica tion has been processed and samples have been received \nat a certification lab.  \n \nLocal Content Requirements  \n \nMexico is a significant and growing market for US film and television creators. However, on a regular basis, \nMexican lawmakers and policymakers propose protectionist policies, such as the imposition of local content \nquotas on theatrical, television, and streaming platforms, limits to the number of screen s on which a given movie \ncan be exhibited or regulating the dubbing of the features regardless of the market preferences. If adopted, such \nmeasures would severely limit the distribution of US content in Mexi co and would potentially contravene \nMexico’s USMCA commitments. Instead, Mexican policymakers should encourage open markets, investments, \nand collaborations that would result in job creation, knowledge transfer, and the internationalization of Mexican \ncontent through the adoption of international best practices, such as audiovisual production incentives, for the \nbenefit of both Mexican and US industries.  \n \nTransportation Consignment Note  \n \nIn the approved 2021 Budget, a line was included that allowed the Secretariat of Communications and \nTransportation (SCT) and the Tax Administration Service (SAT) to increase reporting requirements. To \nimplement these new reporting requirements, the SCT and SAT published regulations that requires a carta porte \n(transportation consignment note), which is an addendum to the invoices that documents the origin, destination, \nand the goods transported inside of the country.  \n \nAs of September 30,  2021,  this carta porte will require the incorporation of new and mandatory catalogues and \ninformation related to the goods, locations of origin, intermediate points , and destinations, and will also refer to \nthe means by which they are transported (either road, rail, air, sea, river or multimodal).   \n \n 99 \n \nThese measures will increase the complexity of the business environment and the conduct of business and trade \nin Mexico and North America. Under the United States -Mexico -Canada Trade Agreement (USCMA), the \ninclusion of a supplement Bill of Lading contradic ts the spirit of the agreement,  and some specific provisions \nestablished in the Customs Administration, Trade Facilitation, and Cross Border Trade in Services chapters.  \n \nDrug Patent Enforcement  \n \nA number of Mexico’s IP commitments pursuant to the USMCA remain outstanding. For example, despite \nMexico’s recent steps to implement patent enforcement mechanisms (i.e., advance a system to resolve outstanding \npatent disputes prior to marketing approval and launch of follow -on products), significant concerns remain with \nthe system.  Further, obtaining effective preliminary injunctions or final decisions on cases regarding IP \ninfringement within a reasonable time (as well as collecting adequate damages when appropriate) remains the \nexception rather than the norm. Additionally, Mexico still lacks measures to restore a portion of the patent term \nlost during the regulatory approval process and consolidation of substantive regulatory data  protection (RDP) in \na federal law is still pending. Also, the new Federal Law for Protection of Industrial Property does not provide \nappropriate RDP for biologics, only for chemical compounds and combinations thereof, contrary to Mexico’s \nUSMCA commitments . \n \nPharmaceutical  \n \nKey issues of concern  include :  \n  \n• Challenges with new public procurement practices: Pharmaceutical manufacturers are currently \nexperiencing significant challenges with the new UNOPS procurement process that negatively impact \ncommercial operations in Mexico and patient access to procured me dicines. This new system, which has \nbeen operational for more than a year, suffers from: (1) fragmented management of the end -to-end process \nfor procuring, supplying , and distributing medicines due to non -interoperability between the Mexican \nGovernment and  UNOPS; (2) logistical barriers for distributors and hospitals that lack needed information \nto verify and accept delivery of procured medicines; and (3) lack of transparency and meaningful \nengagement with affected stakeholders to resolve concerns.  Recent changes in practices accompanied by \nunreasonable implementation timelines have created market access barriers and supply chain challenges \nfor US pharmaceuticals. One example was concerning the contract that Mexico signed in 2021 with the \nUnited Nations Offi ce of Services (UNOPS) for the public procurement of medicines, where there were \nconcerns about that do not misalignment with Mexico’s obligations under USMCA Chapter 13.  These \nchallenges are resulting in shortages of medicines to patients in Mexico, subsequent and duplicate \nprocurement requests from Mexico government public health institutions outside of the UNOPS process, \npurchase orders that are significantly below the volume contracted by UNOPS, lack of payment for \nprocured and supplied medicines and e ven significant daily fines to manufacturers that are not permitted \nto deliver contracted supply due to Mexican government bureaucratic delays. Unfortunately, neither the \nMexican government nor UNOPS accepts full responsibility for these challenges, allowi ng both parties to \navoid ownership of the problems and needed solutions . USCIB understands that the UNOPS experiment \nhas had challenges and been discontinued. Further, in November 2022, the General Council for Health \n(CSG) amended the regulations governing  the Compendium to require applicants to obtain and submit a \nletter of necessity from at least one CSG institution member to participate in government tenders. The \nnecessity letter requirement may be inconsistent with Mexico’s obligations under the USMCA w ith \nrespect to Technical Barriers to Trade, Government Procurement, and Intellectual Property and imposes \nan undue barrier on access to innovative medicines to treat patients in Mexico.   \n \n 100 \n• Market Access Delays:  In Annex 12 -F of the USMCA, Mexico committed to issue determinations \nregarding marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products within a reasonable period of time. \nNevertheless, since early 2019, Mexico’s Federal Commission for Protection against Healt h Risks \n(COFEPRIS) has severely delayed the marketing authorization process for pharmaceutical products. In \naddition, significant existing market access barriers remain due to lengthy, non -transparent and \nunpredictable procurement pro cesses. A lack of transparency around the implementation of a National \nMedicines Compendium (“Compendium”) and disease -specific treatment guidelines, as well as challenges \nand uncertainty in accessing the formularies of public health institutions, create a dditional delays that \nrestrict patient access to innovative medicines.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nIndustry urges the US government to prioritize engagement concerning Mexico's policy framework for electronic \npayment service suppliers. As mentioned in previous reports, current regulatory arrangements continue to limit \nUS suppliers' ability to compete an d fully offer their services and differentiate themselves in Mexico, preventing \ninnovations and security solutions that could be adopted by financial institutions benefiting Mexican citizens and \nsmall businesses.  In September  2023, the Federal Economic Com petition Commission (Cofece), issued its final \nresolution of a 5 -year investigation to the card payments system which confirms the lack of effective competition \nconditions in the market, making a series of recommendations to both the Central Bank of Mexico  (Banxico) and \nthe National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) to eliminate the existing entry barriers that are \nhindering the participation of new entrants, including U S providers. The United States should urge Mexico to \nfacilitate a competitive mar ket and level playing field for U S electronic payment service suppliers, aligned with \nMexico's USMCA obligations, and adjust the legal framework to grant the necessary conditions for the \ninteroperability and competition among payment networks. These actions would not only fulfill Mexico’s \nUSMCA commitments but will also facilitate digital financial inclusion through payments innovation and fraud \nprevention.  \n \nTariffs on Express Shipments  \n \nThe USMCA  entered into force on July 1 , 2020 , and included positive outcomes for US Companies in the Customs \nChapter, including streamlined, simplified, and expedited border processing to help speed border clearance times \nand lower costs for low -value shipments. This included commitments by Mexico to implement new de minimis  \nand informal clearance thresholds.  \n \nMexico has also published new regulations that increased import rates on shipments from the US and Canada \nvalued between US$50 -117 by 1  percent  (from 16  percent  to 17  percent ). For non -USMCA shipments, the import \nrate was also increased by 3  percent  (from 16  percent –19 percent ) for shipments between US$50 -1000. These \nchanges were made without warning or following appropriate protocols, and they became effective immediately. \nWhile this is a small increase, we view it as a violation of the USMCA and a sign t hat the AMLO Administration \ndoes not intend  to implement its customs commitments, and may in fact, take additional steps that will \ndisadvantage U S exporters.  \n \nNew Customs Agency  \n \nOn January 1, 2022, Mexico established the National Customs Agency (ANAM), which replaced the General \nCustoms Administration, priorly housed within SAT. In a significant departure from prior practice, ANAM \nincludes officers of the armed forces in key manag ement and enforcement functions – notably officials with no \nexpertise in customs or trade facilitation. While ANAM is now responsible for the management and operation of  \n \n 101 \nMexican Customs offices, SAT retained other foreign trade -related functions including tax collection, as well as \nthe operation of some IT systems required for customs clearance. The reorganization of the customs functions in \nMexico has resulted in legal an d operational concerns, leaving businesses with further legal uncertainties and \nincreased clearance delays. The United States is concerned with the impact this reorganization will have on \ncoordinated customs efforts and trade facilitation in Mexico.  \n \nWe welcome Mexico’s implementation of its prohibition on the importation of goods made with forced labor, in \nconformity with USMCA. We appreciate that the competency to assess potential forced labor violations rests with \nthe Ministry of Labor and Social We lfare. We, furthermore, encourage USTR, other relevant US agencies, and \ncompetent international organizations to support Mexico in 1) assessing objective and verifiable allegations of \nforced labor and 2) advancing the implementation of sourcing countries’ own domestic forced labor laws to \nprevent and address such issues before export.  \n \nMIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA  (MENA )  \n \nLocal Ownership  \n \nMany countries in the Middle East restrict the provision of telecoms services to locally licensed entities. \nFurthermore, in order to obtain a local telecom license, there is usually a requirement to establish a local entity \nwith the foreign entity as minor ity shareholder. Examples include Saudi  Arabia , UAE, Qatar , and Kuwait. This \nhas historically acted as a barrier to entry and has limited investment and trade in this sector between US -based \nentities and the Middle East.  Greater flexibility and a more fore ign investment friendly framework is required to \nfurther encourage investment between US -based entities and the Middle East.  \n \nRestrictions on Voice of Internet Protocol (VoIP)  \n \nGovernment policies around the world that restrict or prohibit Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other \nforms of Internet telephony create obstacles to continued Internet innovation and have a negative impact on trade \nand investment. Since VoIP is a key application that drives broadband deployment, such prohibitions on VoIP \ncan easily deter cross -border service deployment and negatively impact a broad range of other information flows. \nVoIP restrictions also effectively limit access to, and distribution  of, video applications, such as video \nconferencing, that incorporate real -time voice traffic.   \n \nThe COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of these services and should encourage the authorities to \nadopt a more flexible regulatory framework to allow the deployment of VoIP services, which are increasingly \nrelied upon by many sectors, such as educat ion, health , and government.  \n \nRequirements  to separately engineer service deployments in line with national rules, and/or comply with sui \ngeneris  national licensing requirements are costly and greatly impede, deployment of VoIP and Internet telephony \nservices to a given market , including:  \n \nUSTR should encourage governments to permit the unrestricted use of VoIP to enable US  companies to gain the \neconomies and efficiencies of global platforms, reduce the cost of doing business in foreign countries, and \npromote investment and vigorous information flows.  \n \n   \n \n 102 \nFree Trade Zones (FTZs)  \n \nWe encourage USTR to look more deeply into the challenges that are often associated with the regulation and \noversight of FTZs  and develop , with its interagency colleagues, a government -wide effort to encourage trading \npartners to control the FTZs.  \n \nModification of UAE and Saudi Arabia’s Customs Tariff and World Customs Organization (WCO) Harmonized \nSystem Nomenclature (HS) Updates for 2022  \n \nA new version of the WCO HS enters into force about every 5  years. The most recent version of the HS or HS2022 \nentered into force January 1, 2022.  The next iteration is slated for January 1, 2028, implementation. Most \ncountries use the WCO HS as the basis of the domestic customs tariff whether or not they are Cont racting Parties \nto the WCO HS Convention. Countries are expected to implement new versions of the international HS in a timely \nmanner.  \n \nImplementation of a new version of the HS is to be revenue neutral. However, in practice we find that often there \nare duty rate changes due to either unintentional actions or intentional manipulation. In addition to updating \nnational level domestic customs  tariffs, there is a process to update or transpose WTO market access schedules. \nUnfortunately, schedules are, in some instances woefully behind (e.g., still pending HS2012 confirmation). We \nunderstand USTR and the WTO Committee on Market Access are workin g on updating schedules, but this still \nposes challenges for the trade community.  \n \nIn implementing its HS2022 commitments, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the ‘KSA’) and the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE) have increased the existing applied duties rates on electronic cigarette cartridges from 5 percent \nto 100 percent, far exceeding WTO bound ra tes. Both KSA and the UAE have committed to a 6.5 percent bound \nrate for cartridges.  \n  \nThis action has resulted in significant barriers to trade. USTR should encourage countries to publish their proposed \ndomestic tariff changes, prior to implementation, for review and comment with full consideration of comments \nreceived. Doing so will enable  interested stakeholders to have the opportunity to address inconsistencies in \ntransposition or applied duty rate for consideration and proactive engagement prior to finalization and publication \nof any updated domestic customs tariff. We encourage USTR to secure updated WTO market access schedules \nfor all members as soon as possible, and we encourage engagement at all levels to address this industry concern.  \n \nIoT Policy and Connected Car /Permanent Roaming  \n \nMany countries in the Middle East have recently introduced IoT Regulatory Frameworks which seem to introduce \nprovisions prohibiting, or severely restricting the permanent roaming of IoT services.  \n \nThe Saudi Communications , and Information Technology Commission (CITC) published new regulations \nprovid ing guidelines on the required authorizations for the provision of IoT services in the country. The licensing \nrequirement indicates  that a local license will be required and , while there was no specific reference to any \nprovisions applicable to permanent roaming SIMs in respect to IoT services (e.g ., connected cars), the regulations \nstate that all SIMs in IoT devices imported to the country must be issued by a local licensed operator. This would \nseem to indicate that IoT services based on roaming SIMs (permanent or otherwise) are not permitted. \nFurthermore, the regulations provide stringent provisions for data localization for all IoT services.  \n \nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia published  in 2021  a new Personal Data Privacy Law (PDPL), which contains strict  \n \n 103 \ncross -border data restrictions – namely that except in cases of extreme necessity relating to a threat to the life of \nthe data subject, controllers may not transfer personal data outside the Kingdom unless other limited conditions \nare met, including approv al by the competent authority.  \n \nConcerns over data localization also extend to Saudi Arabia’s cloud computing and cybersecurity regulatory \nframeworks.  \n \nIn Jordan, the IoT Regulatory Framework permits  permanent roaming of IoT services but  is conditioned on the \ninternational IoT service provider reaching a commercial agreement with a Jordanian telecom operator.  \n \nSuch rigid regulations have the potential to stifle foreign investment and restrict trade in this fast -growing sector, \nand as such, the authorities are encouraged to consider these issues and amend the regulations accordingly to \nreduce barriers to entry in  this area.  \n \nIP Content and Piracy  \n \nPiracy remains a significant problem in the region, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, the illegal pirate \nnetwork beoutQ (allegedly based in Saudi Arabia) has led the rampant theft of content in the region. The beoutQ \nservice provides illegal stre ams of local and international broadcast channels (and has previously utilized a Saudi \nbased satellite operator), with a focus on sports content, and features numerous apps through which users can \nstream movies and TV series on demand. The beoutQ service h as mainly targeted content rights held by Qatar’s \nbeIN broadcasting network since July 2017. Recent enforcement efforts by beIN as well as content owners \nglobally against beoutQ have not been successful. Despite beoutQ channels through satellite currently being off -\nair, it is reported that beoutQ continues to provide illegal services through its IPTV channels.  \n \nIn a ruling by the WTO in June 2020, in a case brought by Qatar against Saudi on the protection of intellectual \nproperty rights, the WTO ruled that Saudi Arabia has failed to provide adequate protection to intellectual property \nrights in the country.  \n \nInternational condemnation of beoutQ (as well as Saudi Arabia’s alleged role) continues and tackling this issue \nshould be made a priority in order to protect rights of content owners globally. While Saudi Arabia has taken  \npositive measures, USTR should encourage the government to take more action in combating piracy in the \ncountry.  \n \nPersonal Data Protection  \n \nMany countries in the Middle East and North Africa region  are currently developing various legal and regulatory \nframeworks that address personal data protection. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), where many \ninternational entities operate, published its Data Protection Law No 5  bringing  the DIFC more closely into -line \nwith international data protection laws, such as in Europe, where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \nis applicable throughout. It is also understood that the UAE, at a  federal level, as well as Saudi Arabia, at a national \nlevel, are developing personal data protection laws.  Saudi Arabia published a new Personal Data Privacy Law \n(PDPL), which became  effective in 2022. in 2022.Article 29 of the PDPL reportedly contains strict cross -border \ndata restrictions – namely that except in cases of extreme necessity relating to a threat to the life of the data subject, \ncontrollers may not transfer personal data outside the Kingdom u nless other limited conditions are met, including \napproval by the competent authority.  \n \n   \n \n 104 \nWhile efforts by these countries to protect personal data are a positive development, USTR should encourage the \ngovernments to be more transparent in the development of such laws and to afford interested stakeholders the \nopportunity to consult in the proce ss before they are published.  \n \n• Algeria  \no Pharmaceutical Pricing  – The process for setting prices is not transparent and does not provide \nfor any specific appeal system. Algeria has implemented policies to control prices: (1) products \nthat have corresponding generics on the Algerian market are subject to reference pricin g for \nreimbursement; (2) some patented products with no generic equivalent on the market have been \nreferenced against generics deemed to be in the same therapeutic class; and (3) imported, patented \nproducts are subject to international reference pricing. And for locally manufactured products, \nprices are compared to the price of “competition locally” and regulation doesn’t make it clear on \nwhat exactly competition is, whether it is only the same INN/ or also the same indication. This \nposes new issues for pharmaceutical companies. Due to delays in pricing approvals, combined \nwith new international pricing benchmark, the pricing review for products is often delayed. \nAdditionally, a  25 percent preferential price is afforded to domestic bidders in public procurement \ncontracts.  \no Regulatory delays  – The registration process is slow and addi tional, burdensome requirements for \nobtaining registration to market pharmaceutical innovative products have been implemented. Also, \nlocal manufacturers receive preferred treatment. Algeria imposes import quotas on pharmaceutical \nproducts and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) that are not locall y manufactured, affecting  \npatient access to innovative medicines; and  \no Intellectual property – Algeria has inadequate patent protection, ineffective mechanisms to enforce \npatents, and does not grant RDP. A generic copy of a product covered by an Algerian patent may \nbe granted MA while the patent on the original product is still in effect. This puts the originator in \nan unfair position with no possibility to defend its rights.  \n• Iran \no Localization – In Iran, there is a strong government preference for in -country manufacturers for \ntenders which effectively closes out MNC participation.  \n• Iraq \no Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals  – The situation of counterfeits worsened via parallel trade, which is \nnot clearly or transparently regulated . \no Pharmaceutical product licensing – Prior to 2019, the registration process was considered non -\ntransparent, and guidelines on assessing new submissions were ambiguous. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies received irrational and excessive requests for documentation, beyond the international \nnorms, makin g the registration process long. Also, the law required the molecule to be listed in the \nnational formulary, in order to be considered for registration. However, the formulary listing has \nno clarity on criteria. In 2019, the Iraq regulatory body announced the following improvement in \nthe regulatory system that will accelerate the registration process . \n \nThe minimum documents requested in the fast -track approval process are M3 and M1 (Modules 3 \nand 1)  \n \nIn this new regulation, the HA is not requesting companies to submit the rest of registration dossier \n(M2,  M4, M5) once the primary approval is secur ed (only QC Lab test materials ) \nFinal approval will be conditional only to QC lab tests results.    \n \n 105 \nThe regulatory authority has recently announced a new circular by which they extend the import \nlicense from 1 year to 2 years for the fast track until full approval is granted . However, the formula \nlisting criteria still remains unclear.  \n• Jordan  \no Local preference in government tenders  – The government is not willing to sign the Government \nProcurement Agreement, resulting in preferential  treatment to locally produced generic products \nand affecting MNCs in government tenders. The local preference is towards locally produced \ngenerics, assuming that their forecasted prices are less than the registered brand for the same \nbidding molecule.  \no Burdensome regulatory and pricing policies  – The implementation of regulatory policies, \nbureaucratic procedures and frequent price revision has a negative impact on the registration of \nnovel products and limits the availability of registered products.  \no Innovative industry representation in the Higher Council for Drugs  – The request for \nrepresentation aims to improve policy dialogue on best practices with the government.   \no Regulatory Data Protection (RDP) – Health authorities have consciously taken steps to weaken \ntheir RDP regime  and continue to deny RDP to new indications.  Jordan requires the MA \napplication of a new medicine to be filed within 18 months from the first worldwide regulatory \napproval in order to be considered as a “new chemical entity” and, thus, eligible for RDP. If it is \nnot so filed, a generic version of th at medicine can be approved. Meeting the 18 -month deadline is \ncomplicated by a series of regulatory re quirements established by the JFDA.  \no Prohibition on Permanent Roaming affecting deployment of IoT  – The Telecommunications \nRegulatory Authority (TRA) of Jordan released decision No. 7 -219/7 mandating that eSIMs used \nin Jordan  be programmable by licensed operators in Jordan and have their profiles downloaded \nfrom licensed local operators only, otherwise the devices will lose their connections to Jordanian \nnetworks within a maximum of 90 days.  \n• Morocco  \no Discriminatory pharmaceutical pricing policies  – The price for a drug is picked based on the \nlowest price out of 7 reference countries: France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Turkey , \nand the country of origin (COO). Since Morocco doesn’t have the same sales or medical coverage \nas in these countries, it is not possible to compensate for the low price.  \no Marketing authorization (MA) – MA is granted only to companies that have a manufacturing site \nin Morocco. This law is problematic for many MNCs as they do not hold all the rights to their \nproducts (the MA is owned by a third party, in general a local manufacturer). This means that if a \nMNC wants to do business in Morocco but does not have a manufacturing plant in the country, it \nneeds to make an agreement with a local company.  \no Lack of regulatory data protection – Morocco does not provide effective RDP.  \n \n• Saudi Arabia  \no Drug pricing policies and reimbursements  – Saudi Arabia  lacks a clear price mechanism which \nmakes the market unpredictable for innovative breakthrough medicines. NUPCO is now the main \ngovernment tender for pharmaceuticals, the issues with clarity and confirmed quantities as well on \nthe unilateral decisions without considering industry concerns an d notes.  \no Regulatory data protection (RDP)  – The submission of confidential test or other data for the \nmarketing authorization of innovator drugs are protected for at least five years from the approval \ndate. However, Saudi Arabia has not complied with its own regulation and WTO commitments. It \ndemons trates a lack of effective RDP in Saudi Arabia.   \nIn addition to making no progress on RDP, SAIP  regulations on the compulsory licensing of \npatents  largely disregard comments pharmaceutical innovators provided on  them . By allowing  \n \n 106 \nSAIP to take patents away three years after they are lawfully granted for almost any reason and \nwithout prior notice to the patent holder, the regulations encourage  excessive use of compulsory \nlicenses and deny patent holders the right to adequately defend their property interests.  \no Data Localization  – The Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) has implemented data \nlocalization  requirements under the 2018 Essential Cybersecurity Controls Regulation. These \nrequirements apply to government - and state -owned enterprises , as well as Critical National \nInfrastructure (CNI ), and require these organizations’ “information hosting and storage” to take \nplace within Saudi Arabia”. The Regulation covers a broad range of organizations, from financial \nservices and aviation to oil and gas. There are also additional localization requ irements in the Cloud \nCybersecurity Controls issued by the NCA in 2020. These Controls require CSPs to provide certain  \nservices from within Saudi Arabia , including systems used for storage processing, disaster \nrecovery centers, and systems used for monitoring and support.  \no Procurement  – Saudi Arabia Procurement Law streamline s the process of procurement for \ncontracts and services by allowing greater flexibility in the bidding process, more preference for \nlocal companies and SMEs . \no Drug Patent Enforcement  – It is concerning that t he Saudi government has granted approval to a \nlocal generic  manufacturer to produce a product while a valid patent is in place and the Saudi FDA \nhas granted marketing approval for a local generic product during the regulatory data protection \nterm of an innovative product in reliance on the innovator’s data.  \n▪ The Saudi government also ban s any company which does not host its regional HQ in \nRiyadh/Saudi Arabia from winning any government contracts . This  serves as  a market \naccess barrier for US companies.  \n• Tunisia  \no Government pricing restrictions  – There are no clear rules in Tunisia to refer prices to the \nbenchmark countries. There are three negotiation price points: registration (MoH DPM), market \nintroduction (Main payer PCT) and reimbursement price (Reimbursement body CNAM). The \nopening price for registration should be at  least 12.5 percent lower than the COO price. To have \nthe MA, an “Indigent Patient Assistance Program” is compulsory. It offers 25 percent to 30 percent \nof the total quantity imported for free to s upport indigent population. Additionally, a preferential \nprice advantage of 13 percent is granted to generics produced locally through public tenders. In \nsome cases, the authorities are requesting additional price reductions of up to 50 percent. The \ncriter ia for these requests are not clear nor based in legislation, creating a highly unpredictable \nenvironment for the marketing of new medicines; and  \no Lack of regulatory data protection (RDP)  – Tunisia has not complied with its own law and \ninternational obligations to provide RDP for pharmaceutical product marketing approval, except \nfor products that are already protected in their COO and when their companies have already \nsubmitted a request to p rotect the patent in Tunisia.  \n• United Arab Emirates  \no Data Localization  – The UAE Cybersecurity Council (CSC) requires governments workloads at \nthe federal (UAE) and emirate -level to be hosted in -country. This longstanding requirement applies \nto government agencies and state -owned commercial enterprises alike. Similar localizati on \nobligations apply to the financial services and healthcare sectors. While the UAE Central Bank's \noutsourcing rulebook prohibits the storing and processing of personal information outside the \ncountry by financial services organization s (excluding subsidiaries of foreign banks), the 2019 \nHealth Law also requires the processing of health data to be conducted in -country. Abu Dhabi \nADHICS Standards further prohibit the hosting of information sharing systems on cloud.  \no Domestic Payment System:  The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates is implementing \npolicies to strengthen its domestic payment system. We support and respect these initiatives, and  \n \n 107 \nmeanwhile urge the US government to ensure that US providers may continue to operate and \ncompete on a level playing field and maintain their ability to operate commercially.  \no Data Sovereignty Requirements:  The UAE Government introduced strict sovereignty controls, \nrequiring CSPs that serve the public sector and regulated industries to:  (i) be under the sole \njurisdiction of UAE law; (ii) not fall under foreign jurisdiction and applicable laws; and (iii) have \ndata centers, engineering, security, maintenance and support operations and respective personnel \nphysically located in the UAE. Thes e controls, shared by the UAE Cyber Security Council \nprivately with CSPs, are linked to concerns over US law enforcement access under the CLOUD \nAct, and prevent US CSPs from serving government and regulated customers. In practice, the \ngovernment may certif y US CSPs that provide local ring -fenced infrastructure or work through \ngovernment -linked technology companies such as G42.  \n \nNEPAL  \n \nThe Nepal Clearing House (NCHL) is amid developing a domestic switch - with a vision to roll out a national \npayment switch (NPS) in Q4 2024.  \n \nThere is a possibility of a mandate for domestic routing of ATM and POS transactions and the launch of a local \ncurrency card (Nepal Pay Card) once the switch goes live. Such data localization and pricing interventions could \npose significant concerns for in ternational schemes in Nepal.  \n \nNEW ZEALAND  \n \nDigital Services Tax  \n \nIn late 2023, the previous New Zealand Government introduced the Digital Services Tax Bill (DST Bill). The Bill \nproposes to apply a 3% tax on digital service revenues earned from New Zealand customers by large digital \nservices companies. DST levy a tax on revenue rather than the profit of a business. The new Government elected \nin October 2023 is still deciding whether or how to progress the DST.  An implementation date is forecast as \nJanuary 1, 2025.   \n \nData Sovereignty  \n \nThe NZ Government has admirable ‘Cloud First’ policies55 and has joined a Digital Partnership Agreement with \nChile and Singapore, with supportive provisions that affirm DEPA “partners’ levels of commitments relating to \ntransmission of information and location of computer facilities” and “recogni ze the value of information flows \nand the development of new technologies and services.”56 However, in recent years indigenous Maori groups \nhave increased concern about data on their people being stored outside New Zealand which may have implications \nfor the free flow of data across borders.57 \n \n  \n \n55 https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards -and-guidance/technology -and-architecture/cloud -services/  \n56https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/trade/free -trade -agreements/free -trade -agreements -in-force/digital -economy -partnership -agreement -depa/depa -\nmodules/#bookmark2  \n57 https://data.govt.nz/toolkit/data -governance/maori/   \n \n 108 \nDrug Pricing and Reimbursement  \n \nThough not explicitly stated, PHARMAC’s reimbursement decisions suggest a pharmaceutical must achieve a \ncost per QALY (quality adjusted life year) of less than NZ$10,000 to NZ$15,000 to be considered cost effective. \nThis is despite public spending in other  areas of health proceeding at up to NZ$100,000 per QALY. This approach, \ncombined with the need to stay within a capped budget, means that many of the most effective medicines are not \navailable to New Zealand’s patients. A  study found that between 2009 -2014, 88  percent  of new medicines \navailable in Australia were not available in New Zealand. Almost 10  percent  of these medicines are for diseases \nwith no current treatment available in New Zealand. In 2014, Australia listed 17 new medicines on the \nPharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS), and New Zealand listed just one. The data also showed that the timeliness \nof the  listing in New Zealand was slower than in Australia, taking two years longer, on average, for PHARMAC \nto fund the same medicines compared to Australi a. \n \nIn addition, it is notable that regulatory data protection for pharmaceuticals is now inconsistent with protections \nfor innovative agricultural compounds, including veterinary medicines (increased to 10 years in 2016).  \n \nNIGERIA  \n \nData Localization  \n \nThe Nigerian National Information Technology Development Agency’s (NITDA) Content Data Development \nGuidelines of 2019/2020 require all “sovereign data” to be stored within the country. While the scope of \n‘sovereign data’ remains undefined in the Guidelines , it is understood that all public sector data is captured. In \n2023, a NITDA Amendment Bill and a National Shared Services Corporation (NSSC) Bill were presented to the \nNational Assembly. The NITDA Bill aimed to (i) extend NITDA’s supervisory rights over d igital services \nproviders and the private sector’s use of ICT, (ii) extend NITDA’s 1% tax on foreign digital platforms, (iii) \nintroduce new ICT compliance requirements, and (iv) grant NITDA oversight rights over the telecoms industry. \nThe NSSC Bill aimed t o centralize the provision of ICT infrastructure and services to Nigerian government bodies \nunder a single state -owned corporation (Galaxy Backbone). The NITDA Amendment Bill and the NSSC Bill met \nwith opposition from the telecoms and ICT industries, and, although approved by the National Assembly, were \nnot signed into law by President Buhari. The Bills have yet to be re -tabled in Parliament under the new \nadministration of President Bola Tinubu.  \n \nDigital Taxation  \n \nThe 2020 Finance Act include s income tax obligations for non -resident companies providing digital goods and \nservices in Nigeria. While the law applies to all non -resident companies earning above a certain threshold, \nextensive media coverage and analysis by experts has repeatedly ment ioned the targeting of US multinationals. \nThe law specifically references non -resident companies with a “significant economic presence” in the country \nwhich is defined by a number of factors including: a minimum amount of revenu e generated from users in Nigeria, \ntransmitting data about Nigerian users, or the availability of local websites or local payment options. Exceptions \nhave been built into the law for companies that are covered by a multilateral agreement to which the Niger ian \ngovernment is a party.  \n \n   \n \n 109 \nForeign Excha nge Controls  \n \nIn June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced the removal of the exchange rate peg and the \nintroduction of the “Willing Buyer, Willing Seller” model. Despite the liberalization of the foreign exchange \nmarket, the CBN maintains stringent control s over the repatriation of funds, which are inconsistent with a willing \nbuyer willing seller market. These controls include the requirement for CBN approval to purchase foreign \nexchange using funds in Non -Resident local currency accounts, despite such acco unts being pre -approved by the \nCBN for the collection of local currency funds by foreign companies. The approval process for the repatriation of \nfunds remains a significant barrier to investment by U.S. entities, as it is frequently subject to delays and d enials. \nIt is recommended that the CBN abolish the approval requirement for the repatriation of funds in Non -Resident \naccounts.  \n \nNORWAY  \n \nDigital Sovereignty and Ownership Requirements  \n \nThe Norwegian government plans to create a national cloud solution for a broad range of critical entities, requiring \npublic sector companies to store over 60% of data using this national service. The government is also applying \npressure to extend this to s ectors such as energy, telecoms and financial services. The national cloud solution can \nonly be developed by Norwegian providers within Norwegian borders.  \n \nPAKISTAN  \n \nData Localization  and Privacy Protections  \n \nPakistan has published many iterations of a draft Data Protection Bill which  is inspired by the GDPR . Data \nlocalization requirements and impediments to the cross -border flow of “sensitive” and “critical” data are of \nconcern, among other provisions . These are of concern, among other provisions . There are also concerns about a \nproposed  National Commission for Personal Data Protection with extensive powers to introduce new regulatory \nframeworks which may create further blockers. Given the wide and open -ended definitions of sensitive and critical \ndata, this proposal could seriously impede cross -border data flows and free trade.  \n \nPakistan launched a Cloud First Policy in 2022. This policy imposes data localization requirements on wide and \nopen -ended classes of data (“restricted ,” “sensitive ,” and “secret”). In the financial sector, the State Bank of \nPakistan (SBP) prohibits financial sector institutions from storing and processing core workloads on offshore \ncloud.  These data localization requirements are ineffective at enhancing data protectio n, and significantly increase \ncosts for US firms, potentially deterring market entry.  \n \nInternet Services  \n \nIn October 2021, Pakistan issued the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight \nand Safeguards), Rules 2021” (Rules) which superseded the 2020 version of the Rules.  The Rules apply to the \nremoval and/or blocking of online content  that is deemed unlawful on any “information system”. Local and \ninternational industry players have expressed concerns regarding provisions that would pose significant barriers \nto operating in Pakistan, including requirements to deploy mechanisms to monito r and block livestreaming \ncontent, remove content within short timeframes when ordered by the authorities, and provide data to authorities \nin decrypted and readable format.   \n  \n \n 110 \nDigital Payment Systems  \n \nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is pushing to have its domestic payment system, 1LINK, process domestic \ntransactions despite no regulatory mandate or circular in place. The SBP is driving this through an Industry -Led \nSteering Committee, which comprises is suing banks, 1LINK, fintech, and the Pakistan Banks Association. This \nis a marked change from when the SBP was previously allowing banks to choose their payment network rather \nthan be pushed to use one domestic network only. This represents a trade barrier  to processing domestic \ntransactions in Pakistan for international payment networks.  \n \nPANAMA  \n \nData Residency  \n \nThe Government Innovation Authority (AIG) of Panama published (09/10) resolution No. 52 ordering all cloud \nservices, mission -critical, or state -security databases, or sensitive institutional data of all Government Entities \nmust be held in Panamanian territ ory by December 31, 2022.  \n \nData Localization  \n \nResolutions 52 and 03 of the Government Innovation Authority AIG (former Government, 2021 and 2024) order \nthat any government entity that uses cloud services for critical mission or state security platforms or sensitive \ninstitutional data hosted on servers  outside the Republic of Panama must make the necessary adjustments and \nchange the location to the Republic of Panama before 31 December 2024.    In order to continue to support the \ngovernment in serving its citizens and businesses, these resolutions should  be removed. In an increasingly \nglobalised world, and one in which Panama seeks to become a regional hub, data localisation could inhibit open \ndata flows and new innovations such as generative AI and create cybersecurity risks.  \n \nPARAGUAY  \n \nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation  \n \nIn addition to other measures listed in USTR’s NTE Report, Paraguay also requires homologation certificates \nissued by Conatel (Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones) to import smartphones. Importers have in some \ncases, and due to seasonal demands, experi enced extended approval times of more than 10 weeks, limiting their \nability to import products to serve local demand.  \n \nPERU  \n \nGMO Labeling  \n \nPeru has notified the WTO of a Draft Regulation on the Labelling of Genetically Modified Foods. The draft \nregulation addresses “genetically modified foods” whereas USCIB members have noted the application of the \nterm “genetically modified” may not apply to  finished processed food products themselves. Finished processed \nfoods may be derived from a genetically modified organism (GMO), contain a GMO, or contain ingredients \nderived from GMOs, but are not genetically modified themselves. Therefore, the definitio n as proposed would be \npotentially misleading to consumers and should be revised so that it does not give a false impression that the final \nfood or individual ingredients are genetically modified themselves.    \n  \n \n 111 \nThe proposed regulation does not establish a threshold for allowing  incidental or adventitious presence of \ngenetically modified material (e.g., resulting from transportation and/or storage).  The regulation appears to require \ntesting to a zero threshold (e.g., to the limit of detection), which creates significant challenges and poses an undue \nrestriction since the limit of detection is affected by testing method, type of food or ingredient, sam pling process, \nsample size, calibration of equipment, and may eve n vary from laboratory to laboratory where other variables are \nidentical.  \n \nSo much so, that in 2019 the Peruvian National Institute for the Defense of Competition and Intellectual Property \n(INDECOPI) has sanctioned companies for not including information related to GMOs on the labels of their \nproducts, pursuant to the Consumer Pr otection Code.  \n \nUSCIB members submitted comments urging Peru to reconsider appropriate definitions and revise the draft \nregulation to establish a threshold of GMO content above which products must be labeled, particularly taking into \naccount that highly refined ingredient s cannot be said to “contain” detectable GM material. Peru should establish \ndefinitions, disclosure language, and thresholds that are truthful and not misleading while establishing clear, \nenforceable, and effective controls. However, such controls must not  overly restrict trade when products contain \nhighly refined ingredients, have low amounts of GM material, and/or have very low levels of unintentional, \nadventitious genetic contamination. Given the comments in item four above, USCIB members believe the \nproposed 180 -day compliance period was insufficient for manufacturers and distributors to comply with the draft \nregulation.   \n \nMoreover, in November 2011, the Peruvian Congress approved Law No. 29811. The law initiated an immediate \nten-year moratorium on the cultivation and import for cultivation of genetically engineered organisms, such as \nseeds, and on the importation of product s derived from agricultural biotechnology, because of concerns that these \nproducts may adversely affect biodiversity. However, living modified organisms and their by -products imported \nfor direct human consumption and animal feeding or to be processed are e xempt from this moratorium.  \n \nFurthermore, Moratorium on Genetically Modified Crops (Law Nº 31111) has become a trade barrier without any \nscientific or precatory support. The market for hard yellow corn for animal feed (pigs -poultry) has been growing. \nAs of 2020, imports have reached 3 ,633,678 kg and the dependence on non -GMO supplier countries (Mexico \n63% - Thailand 18%) limits market opportunities and makes Peru vulnerable to shortages. Additionally, Peru \ncontinues to prohibit the use of biotech seed, reducing its competitiveness comp ared to other countries in the \nregion. Of concern are:  \n• Zero tolerance for events – the Environment Ministry tests conventional imported seed shipments upon \narrival, raising concerns among seed traders. Detection of a GMO event in seeds, including adventitious \npresence, results in high fines. The union and the Ministry must work together to establish reasonable \nGMO thresholds supported by technology and science.  \n• New breeding techniques – it is not yet clear how the government of Peru will interpret the genome -edited \ncrops . \n• CMA – multisectoral commission. Participation of industry in the multisectoral commission is needed.  \n \nNutrition Labeling  \n \nIn Peru  regulations defining processed foods are too broad, and the nutrition criteria so strict, many pre -packaged \nfoods are considered “high in” added sugar, sodium and/or saturated fat and therefore subject to additional \nprovisions including warning labels occupying at least 10  percent  of the front -of-package, and restrictions on the \nmarketing and advertising of these products.  Specifically, the warning label must state: “High in (Sugar and/or \nSodium and/or Saturated Fat): Avoid Excessive consumption.”   \n \n 112 \n \nThe WTO TBT Agreement calls on member states to ensure that technical regulations be “no more trade restrictive \nthan necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -fulfillment would create.”  WTO \nMembers are required to assess those risks on the basis of “available scientific and technical information.” Peru \nprovides no scientific support for the criteria in  the regulation, and no justification for the departure from existing \nCodex standards, including Codex General Guidelines o n Claims (CAC/GL 1 -1979) which prohibits claims on \nlabels which “could arouse or exploit fear in the consumer,” and Codex Guidelines for Nutrition and Health \nClaims (CAC/GL 23 -1997) stating “health claims must be based on current relevant scientific substa ntiation and \nthe level of proof must be sufficient to substantiate the type of claimed effect and the relationship to health as \nrecognized by generally accepted scientific review of the data and the scientific substantiation should be reviewed \nas new knowl edge becomes available.”  \n \nOnline Piracy  \n \nThere is currently a new mode of piracy through which IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) equipment is used \nwith which it is possible to illegally obtain TV signals using broadband connections over the IP protocol. The \ntechnology of this equipment allows them to be used as illegal decoders of TV signals from pay TV operators and \nthen make them available to anyone.  \n \nThere  is no restriction in Customs (ADUANAS) for the entry into the country of IPTV equipment. This problem \nhas been communicated and documented to the corresponding authorities ; however, actions have not been taken \nso that the equipment  continues  to enter the country. Given this, a statement from the Ministry of Transportation \nand Communications requires  IPTV equipment to be declared as restricted merchandise and its entry into the \ncountry is avoided, as was the case with the FTA equipment.  \n \nHomologation Process for Smartphones  \n \nThe Homologation process in Peru were reformed by the Supreme Decree Nº 019 -2019 -MTC  to specify ( 1) the \nTAC58 number and ( 2) the accreditation of the Cell Broadcast functionality that allows the equipment to be \nconfigured with the parameters of the Messaging System of Early Emergency Alert – SISMATE.  The process in \nplace is disrupting the importation process and this system is challenging the operational capacity of the \ngovernment since the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is not properly staffed to support the \nworkload created by this ne w process.  \n \nIn order to assure a smooth market access to smartphones importers in Peru, USCIB urges USTR to encourage \nthe Peruvian government to implement technology tools that allow importers in Peru to adequately serve the \nmarket.  \n \nExcessive Level of Sanctions in Telecommunications Sector  \n \nOSIPTEL and MTC are in charge of fulfillment control in relation to the regulatory framework. However, they \nperform a very intrusive scheme of control that involves more than 200 templates for recurrent reports and \npermanent requests for extra information,  audits , and technical reviews. This produces a big regulatory cost and \nthe sanctions for minimum details of compliance are high. It is  important to encourage Peruvian authorities to \nfocus the control activities on relevant issues for the market and avoid the imposition of fines with collection aim.  \n \n58 The Type Allocation Code (TAC) is an 8 digit number allocated to 3GPP device manufacturers by the GSMA. Manufacturers use TAC  to create a \nunique identifier for a mobile device known as the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI).   \n \n 113 \n \nCopyright Liability Regimes for Online Intermediaries  \n \nPeru remains out of compliance with key provisions under the US -Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA).  \nArticle 16.11, para. 29 of the PTPA requires certain protections for online intermediaries against copyright \ninfringement claims arising out of user activities.  Industry urges USTR to engage with Peru and push for full \nimplementation of the trade agreement and establish intermediary protections within the parameters of the PTPA.  \n \nDigital Trust Framework Draft Regulations   \n \nIn 2020, the Digital Government Secretariat of Peru released Emergency Decree 007  – Digital Trust Framework \ndraft regulations for consultation.59 It gives preferential treatment to domestic data storage and domestic service \nproviders  and includes: (1) the creation of a whitelist of permitted countries for cross -border transfer of data, even \nthough the Peruvian Data Protection Law does not include such restrictions; (2) the issuance of digital security \nquality badges for private companies w hich will be the governmental cybersecurity certification (ignoring the \nexistence of global security standards); and (3) the creation of a national data center intended to host the \ninformation provided by the public sector entities.  It also includes b road definitions of digital services providers, \nfailing to consider key differences among digital services and the differences in these services' ability to access \nclient’s information, or organizations that use digital channels to provide their services. The Data Protection \nAuthority determine s model contract clauses, which appear to exceed what is currently required under the Data \nProtection Law.  The National Data Center incentivize s domestic data storage by providing infrastructure to \ndomestic data cente r operations, granting the government control over the data.  \n \nAs noted elsewhere in these comments, the ability to move data and access information across borders is essential \nfor businesses regardless of size or sector.  Peru should instead rely on the already approved Guidelines for the \nUse of Cloud Services for entities of the Public Administration  and endorse the use of international standards and \nbest practices, which are accepted and adopted, such as ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27002, ISO 27017, ISO 27018 , \nand SOC 1, 2 and 3.  \n \nAdditionally, implementing  measures for the National System of Digital Transformation were issued by Peru's \nSecretariat for Digital Governance in 2020 (Decree 1412/2020, with further regulations in Decree 29 -2021 PCM).  \n \nTrade Facilitation  \n \nUnder Article 5.7(g) of the U S-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (the “Agreement”), the parties established a de \nminimis, the value threshold below which no customs duties or taxes are charged on imported goods. The \nAgreement’s de minimis threshold is set at $200. However, the Peruvian go vernment has implemented limitations \nto the number of shipments (three maximum) under the express delivery shipments that an individual without tax \nnumber (RUC) can do per year. Also, for individuals, it is uncertain if above the three shipments these personal \nimports would be considered commercial and create new income tax obligations. Thus, this RUC requirement \nlimits the ability for individuals to import goods for personal use, which constitutes a trade barrier and a limitat ion \nto the use of express delivery shipments in Peru.  \n \n  \n \n59 José Antonio Olaechea, Doing business in Peru: overview , THOMSON REUTERS PRACTICAL LAW, https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0 -500-\n7812?transitionType=Default\u0026contextData=(sc.Default)\u0026firstPage=true (last accessed Oct. 29, 2020).   \n \n 114 \nPHILIPPINES  \n \nInternet Transactions Act  \n \nThe Internet Transactions Act of 2023 (ITA) is a Philippine  law that regulates e -commerce to protect consumers \nand merchants a nd to promote data privacy and intellectual property  rights.  It applies to all business -to-business \nand business -to-consumer internet transactions when one party is in the Philippines, or when the online  merchant \nor digital platform caters to the Philippine market.  It does not cover consumer to consumer transactions or online \nmedia content.   A key feature is its takedown enforcemen t mechanism and subsidiary liability fo r e-marketplaces \nand digital platforms.    \n \nData Protection  \n \nWe encourage USTR to dialogue with the Philippines government to ensure that amendments to the D ata Privacy \nAct do not impose unnecessary barriers to cross -border data flows and would not add unnecessary compliance \ncosts to businesses.   \n \nLocal Ownership Requirements  \n \nPhilippines prohibits foreign investment in mass media, including the pay -TV and broadcasting sectors.  These \nrestrictions impede capital inflows, limit the choices available to Philippine consumers, and inhibit the growth of \nthese sectors in the Philippines.   \n \nGovernment Procurement  \n \nThe government procurement system in the Philippines generally favors Philippine nationals or Filipino \ncontrolled enterprises for procurement contracts. Republic Act No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform \nAct, specifies a minimum Filipino ownership requirement of at least 60 percent in the procurement of goods, \nconsulting services, and infrastructure projects. Domestic goods are also given preferential treatment over \nimported products in the bid evaluation pro cess.  Additionally, Executive Order No. 120, issued in 1993 directs \ngovernment departments and agencies, including government -owned and controlled corporations, to exert best \nefforts to negotiate countertrade equivalent to at least 50 percent of the valu e of contracts on foreign capital \nequipment, machinery, products, goods, and services worth at least $1 million. Government Procurement Policy \nBoard Resolution 14 -2005 states that a government agency must comply with the provisions of RA9184 if it \ndecides to adopt countertrade as an internal procurement policy. The New Government Procurement Act (NGPA), \nwhich was signed into law on July 20, 2024, looks to enhance the existing procurement systems implemented by \nthe 21 -year-old Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. The  new law states that preference and priority are given to \nPhilippine products. As per Section 79, \"The procuring Entity shall award the domestic bidder if the bid is not \nmore than twenty -five (25%) in excess of the lowest foreign bid. The margin of preference provided herein shall \nbe subject to a periodic review and adjustment by the  GPPB, as may be necessary.\" However, the domestic \npreference can be waived if specific conditions are met, such as if the priority and preference will result in \ninconsistencies  with obligations under international agreements. While US cloud service providers are active in \nthe Philippine market, they continue to face constraints that limit their participation, particularly in competing for \ngovernment projects. The Philippines requires government agencies to procure cloud computi ng services from \nthe Government Cloud (also known as GovCloud), a cloud infrastructure set up by the Department of Information \nand Communications Technology. The Philippines is not a Party to the WTO Agreem ent on Government \nProcurement but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since June 2019.  \n  \n \n 115 \nGovernment Procurement Restrictions on Cloud Services  \n \nWhile US cloud service providers are active in the Philippines, they continue to face constraints that limit their \nparticipation, particularly in competing for government projects. While the rules in public sector procurement do \nnot explicitly require a lo cal partner, but effectively force foreign bidders to get local partners. For example, when \nselling cloud services to the public sector, one of the requirements is that a foreign provider must secure a license \nto do business in the Philippines from the Sec urities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (see Government \nProcurement Policy Board Resolution No. 14 -2021). As US CSPs do not hold a license with the SEC, they are \nrequired to work with local partners.  \n \nLicensing Restrictions on Cloud Services  \n \nTelecommunications regulators have sometimes interpreted existing regulations to mean that cloud service \nproviders are required to obtain a Valued Added Telecom Services license, which is open only to Filipino \ncompanies. The requirement has not been consis tently enforced, but if it were, it could severely limit overseas \ncompanies’ ability to provide cloud services in the Philippines.  \n \nFinancial Services  \n \nThe Philippines continues to require mandatory lending to the agricultural and agrarian reform sectors under the \nRepublic Act No. 10000, which requires banks to lend 25 percent  of their loanable funds to the agricultural and \nagrarian reform sectors. Mandated lending should be eliminated in the Philippines as has been done in Indonesia \nand Thailand. Foreign banks face difficulties in complying with the law due access to these sec tors, and \ninfrastructure (e.g. , limits on branching capability). The practice of  mandated lending has been abandoned in \nIndonesia and Thailand.  \n \nTelecommunications Services  \n \nUnder the amended Public Services Act (PSA) which took effect in April 2022, public services engaged in the \nprovision of telecommunications services are considered critical infrastructure. Foreign nationals may own more \nthan 50 percent of public services e ngaged in the operation and management of critical infrastructure, subject to \nreciprocity requirements.  \n \nThe Philippines allocates and manages spectrum through the Radio Control Law of 1931 (RA 3846 and its \namendment, RA 584), Executive Order No. 546 1979, and the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of 1995 \n(RA 7925). These laws and directives provide the co untry’s legal framework for spectrum enfranchisement, \noperation, and permitting in line with International Telecommunication Union requirements, and general \nprovisions on the allocation and assignment of radio spectrum.  \n \nWhile RA 7925 requires the conduct of open tenders in allocating spectrum, no public bidding has ever been \ncarried out to allocate spectrum (e.g., spectrum auctions). Evaluation of applications typically involves the \nsubmission by an applicant of a letter of request to the National Telecommunications Commission for its spectrum \nneeds. This model is inherently non -transparent, constituting an administrative approach by which applicants are \nchosen based on the government’s prioritization of certain criteria ( like financial or technical capacity).  \n \nKonektadong Pinoy (previously called the Open Access in Data Transmission bill) is a key measure that still \nawaits Congressional approval. Even though the amendments to the Public Services Act opened up the \ntelecommunications sector for foreign ownership, new entrants face significant barriers due to the requirement of  \n \n 116 \nsecuring a legislative franchise (the Philippines is the only country that requires a legislative franchise for \ntelecommunications or data transmission entities). The market remains largely a duopoly and is dominated by \nlocal telecommunication companies, G lobe and PLDT Smart.  \n \nTaxation  \n \nThe Philippines maintains an array of taxes on film distribution, which collectively make for an oppressive tax \nregime curtailing economic activity in the film distribution sector – includ ing 30 percent income tax on net profits, \n5 percent withholding tax on net receipts, 10 percent  tax on distributor’s share of box office, duties on prints and \ntrailer imports, tax on advertising materials, tax on royalty remittances.  We encourage USTR to work with the \nPhilippine government on developing taxation principles  that are consistent with global best practices . \n \nPOLAND  \n \nPolish Cybersecurity Act (NIS 2 Directive Implementation)  \n \nThe draft law will update and expand existing cybersecurity regulations in Poland and  will introduce the \npossibility for the Minister of Digital Affairs to designate High Risk Vendors (HRV). If an entity is designated as \nan HRV, it would be required to remove its equipment or software from the systems of essential entities, important \nentities and telecommunications operators within a designated time period. As the rules are broad, there is a risk \nof arbitrary designation of non -EU providers as HRVs. The draft has undergone a public consultation and is now \nawaiting further review, but these controversial provisions are likely to be maintained.  \n \nSINGAPORE  \n \nLicensing of Cyber Security Service Providers (CSP’s)  \n      \nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has a licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers \nthat went into effect in 2022. Initial services under the license scope include the providers of Managed Security \nOperations Centers and Penetration testing services. All Cyber security service Providers (CSPs) that provide \neither or both of these cybersecurity services to the Singapore market need to be licensed. Resellers, or overseas \nCSPs who provide license -required cybersecurity services to the Si ngapore market also need to be licensed. This \nadds to the increasing compliance burden for global CSP’s providing services in the Singapore market.  \n \nHTA  Framework  \n \nThe Singapore Government started HTA implementation in Singapore with focus on recommending the lowest -\npriced drugs available. There is no published disease review schedule or information on the review committee \nmembers.  It is therefore important for collaboration between government and industry to ensure there is consistent \ninformation being shared with regards to HTA implementation in Singapore, especially regarding criteria and \nrequirements.  \n \nSingapore should also update patent term extension policies to compensate for clinical testing and marketing \napproval processes that are integral to the development of innovative medicines.  Clinical trials represent an \nintegral and indispensable part of the marketing approval process in Singapore. Many developed countries’ \nintellectual property regimes include clinical trials when calculating patent term extension periods ( e.g., European \nEconomic Area, Switzerland, Australia, Japan US, South Korea).   \n \n 117 \nIt is therefore important to update patent term extension policies to compensate for clinical testing and marketing \napproval processes that are integral to the development of innovative medicines.  \n \nForeign Interference (Countermeasures) Act   \n \nThe Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) was passed in 2021. in 2021.FICA requires online \nservices to remove content or carry “corrections” on their platforms in response to claims from the government \nor from individuals that content is being covertly influenced by a foreign actor. It is important that FICA, with its \nbroad powers and the anticipatory nature of some of its proposed directions, be used judiciously to weed out \ncoordinated influence campaigns and not as a modality of targeting criti cal political speech. How the law is used \nmatters, and other countries in the region will be paying attention to the news of FICA passing into law, and the \nscenarios in which those powers are eventually deployed.  The use of broad -ranging powers to moderate content \non internet platforms, and its impact on free speech, matters. Such powers have the potential for regional/global \ncontagion.  \n \nSRI LANKA  \n \nIn August 2022, Sri Lanka issued Import and Exports (Control) Regulations No. 13 that banned the importation \nof over 300 types of goods, including many critical industrial products and essential consumer devices.  The \ngovernment has since begun to relax so me of the restrictions, but the process by which the government reviews \nand decides upon revisions to the list of banned products is opaque and unpredictable.  The ongoing ban creates \nburdens for US  exporters, as well as for consumers and SMEs in Sri Lanka . \n \n \nSOUTH AFRICA   \n \nLocal Content Requirements  \n \nSouth Africa’s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies include “Equity Equivalent” provisions by which \nmultinational companies can contribute to advancement of minority groups in lieu of explicit share set -asides. \nThese rules include local content and ma nufacturing provisions that are inconsistently interpreted and applied, \nhindering availability of best -in-class ICT products and services in South Africa.  \n \nNational Data and Cloud Policies  \n \nIn 2021, the South African Department of Communications and Digital Technologies issued proposals for a \nNational Data and Cloud Policy that contain several restrictions to cross -border data flows, including the \nobligation to process and store within the bo rders of South Africa all data classified/identified as critical \nInformation Infrastructure.  Furthermore, cross -border transfer of citizen data shall only be carried out in adherence \nwith South African privacy protection policies and legislation (POPIA), t he provisions of the Constitution, and in \ncompliance with international best practices and notwithstanding, a copy of such data must be stored in South \nAfrica for the purposes of law enforcement.  \n \nMedia and Entertainment Sector  \n \nSouth Africa imposes content quotas on broadcast and pay -TV sectors that limit access of its consumers to foreign \nTV content.  At the same time, South Africa has seen a significant growth in sales of set top boxes used to bypass \nencryption on pay -TV or to access pirated content, with little to no enforcement against this activity.  These  \n \n 118 \npolicies substantially interfere with the growth of the legitimate market in South Africa.  South Africa is also \nconsidering a revision to its copyright law that raises several concerns regarding its compatibility with treaty \nobligations including TRIPS, and that would stifle investment in a number of ways, such as though interfering \nwith contractual freedom in the context of content production and distribution.  \n \nElectronic Payment Services  \n \nFollowing multiple consultations with US stakeholders, there was an amendment of the Payment Association of \nSouth Africa (PASA) Payment Clearing House (PCH) System Operator Criteria (focusing on domestic \nprocessing) effective from August 1, 2023. The policy requires that, for domestic transactio ns, payment service \noperators must:  \n \n• Render clearing services and transaction authorization through infrastructure that is established and \nmaintained in South Africa.  \n• Store data and retain records related to these services within the country.  \n \nSuch a policy may deter and/or limit the ability of international payment players to operate in the market and \ncontribute to economic growth with innovative products and services.  \n \nData Localization  \n \nSouth Africa’s Data and Cloud Computing Policy, published  in May 2024 by the Department of Communications \nand Digital Technologies (DCDT), contains data sovereignty provisions. The Policy states that “data that \nincorporates content pertaining to the protec tion and preservation of national security and sovereignty of the \nRepublic shall be stored only in digital infrastructure located within the borders of the Republic”. The scope of \ncovered data remains unclear.  \n \nSPAIN  \n \nRoyal Decree – Law 7/2021 - Sales of Goods and Supply of Digital Content Directives  \n \nSpain rushed through transposition of Sales of Goods and Supply of Digital Content Directives under an \nemergency procedure (RD -L) involving no consultation, impact assessment or other stakeholder involvement, but \nbeing directly approved by the Council of Ministers, without being previously announced, despite the \nimplementing act diverging significa ntly from the text of the directives. Apart from this approach being \nincompatible with the general principles of transparency and stakeholder involvement to which  member states \nsigned up to under the better regulation initiative, the divergence from the EU texts risks creating barriers to trade, \nfragmenting the Single Market, and undermining legal certainty.  Implementing such divergent rules without a \nproper impact assessment creates  legal uncertainty for especially smaller cross -border players and create s a market \nbarrier for traders and manufacturers, requiring them to operate differently in Spain in comparison to other \nmarkets.  \n \nRepair and after sales services – While Directive (EU) 2019/771 should not impose an obligation on sellers to \nensure the availability of spare parts throughout a period of time as an objective requirement for conformity, the \nnational law sets that Producer s must ensure the existence of (i) an adequate technical service, as well as (ii) spare \nparts for a minimum period of 10 years from the date on which the good ceases to be manufactured.  \n \n   \n \n 119 \nRTVE ( National Public Service Media Organism) Levy \n \nThe Spanish government is aiming at using the transposition of the AVMSD as an instrument to mandate Video \non Demand services (such as Prime Video) and video -sharing platforms (such as Twitch) to finance the public \nbroadcaster RTVE by paying a levy equal to 1.5  percent  of their Net Annual Revenue.  \n \nThe obligation to finance RTVE was first introduced when the government decided to prohibit publicity on RTVE , \nso it needed to obtain funds from other sources. This levy is currently paid by the following players with varying \nrates: (1) Local free TV: 3  percent  of net revenue, (2) Pay TV: 1.5  percent  of net revenue and Telecoms: 0.9  \npercent  of net revenue. After 15 years of lobbying , the Telcos will be exempt from this obligation with the new \nlaw. \n \nTAIWAN  \n \nNews Media Bargaining Code  \n \nTaiwan  may impose a mandatory news media bargaining code to regulate commercial relations between news \npublishers and digital platforms. USCIB  is concerned  the Code may be in tension with longstanding international \ntrade principles of national treatment and most favored nation (MFN), by unfairly discriminating against foreign \ndigital service suppliers and providing preferential treatment to local advertising  and other digital service \nsuppliers.  \n \nData Residency/Data Localization  \n \nTaiwan’ s data residency and data localization regulations and requirements governing the use of cloud services \nprovided by third parties. In the financial services sector, regulations require that material financial customer data \nbe stored within the country , unless an exemption has been obtained by the regulatory agency. In the healthcare \nsector, regulations governing Electronic Medical Records Management  require medical data be stored within the \ncountry unless an exemption has been obtained with the governing agency. In both cases, the regulations \ngoverning how to obtain an exemption are vague and unclear.  \n \nDraft Amendment to Cybersecurity Management Act  \n \nIn September 2023, the Taiwan government announced the draft of amendment to Cybersecurity Management \nAct (CSMA).). The draft requires sectoral regulators to issue rules governing the criteria and the process to \ndesignate a critical infrastructure (CI) pro vider. The draft defines CI as “physical or virtual systems or networks, \nused in the critical fields formally announced by the Cabinet, once discontinued from operation or becoming less \neffective, would lead to significant negative impact upon the national  security, public interests, living standard of \ncitizen and economic activities.” The draft does not specify the process and criteria of  how the Cabinet selects \nand decides the so -called “critical fields”.  A private entity may be designated as a CI provider by a sectoral \nregulator and thus to be subject to obligations under CSMA. However, the criteria and process to select and decide \nthe “critical fields” lack transparency and creates uncertainty. This measure goes against the principle of good \nregulatory practice, but also raises compliance costs and potential barriers to potentially impacted sectors.  \n \nThe draft  amendment also would ban the use of ‘China -Branded’ Products by its agencies. The ban applies directly \nto Taiwanese government agencies, with indirect implications to its solution providers who will be contractually \nrequired to comply with the ban. Terms used in the measure are vague or not clearly defined, e.g., the definition \nof “China -branded” and the scope of ICT products. The draft also does not define “products that endanger national  \n \n 120 \ncyber security” as well as the criteria and process to decide whether a product endangers national cyber security \nor not.  Most important of all, a supplier may not know its products are banned in the public sector and has no \nmeans to ask for an appeal.  T he vagueness and uncertainty have created practical impediments to doing business \nin Taiwan.   \n \nRestrictions to Cloud Services   \n \nTaiwan’s  FSC amended  the Regulation Governing Internal Operating Systems and Procedures for the \nOutsourcing of Financial Institution Operation, requiring financial institutions to obtain FSC’s permission prior \nto using cloud computing services. However, the burdensome approva l process imposes unnecessary compliance \ncosts and security risks for both the financial institutions and cloud service providers. The process requires \nsubmitting up to 17 documents, duplicated audit requests and a lengthy review proces s, which may discourage \nfinancial institutions from using cloud computing services, and thereby limiting market access for US cloud \nservices providers. In addition, there’s currently no similar regulations addressing cloud outsourcing needs and \ninstitutions are requested to discuss with FSC on case -by-case basis for Securities and Futures sector, e -Payment \nservice providers, and fintech start -ups, which elevates Cloud adoption entry barrier constrained by the lack of \nguidelines.  \n \nWithholding  Criteria for Confidential Business Information (CBI) on Safety Data Sheets (SDS)  and Product \nLabels  \n \nThe speed of R\u0026D development and degree of CBI protection are key to Taiwan’s competitiveness in high tech \nindustries such as semiconductor s and printed circuit board s. However, Taiwan’s Ministry of Labor imposes \nstringent CBI review criteria for SDS that impedes this goal. MOL provides no distinction between R\u0026D samples \nand finished products  and requires sharing of information on testing endpoints  for each classification.  USCIB \nurges MOL to revise its process  to exempt products used for R\u0026D  to better prot ect workers and downstream users \nwithout compromising further industrial development.  \n \nTANZANIA  \n \nDigital Services Tax  \n \nThe Tanzanian Revenue Authority recently issued a public notice outlining the VAT and DST obligations of non -\nresident providers of cross -border electronic services. According to the notice, all non -resident providers of \nelectronic services must register fo r VAT and DST. This tax implication is a potential deterrent to the business of \ninternational cross -border payment service providers that do not have local presence / infrastructure.  \n \nTHAILAND  \n \nMarket Access for OTT Services  \n \nThailand’s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (the NBTC)  is a governing policy on the \nclassification of owners and operators of OTT services.  The intention of the policy is to have owners and operators \nof onshore and offshore OTT services to be subject to the same or similar regulations as traditional broadcasters \nand telecommunications companies, including requirements to obtain and pay for ope rating licenses, pay a value \nadded tax, and be subject to stringent checks on illegal content .  \n \n   \n \n 121 \nUSCIB urges USTR to raise concerns with Thailand’s moves to regulate OTT services, which often are delivered \nwithout a local presence and should be treated with a flexible and light touch framework.  \n \nFurther, USTR should urge Thailand to further broaden the list of telecommunications services that can be \nprovided by foreign carriers and eliminate the restriction on foreign ownership of telecommunications businesses. \nExpanding market access would increase compet ition and stimulate new investment in the Thai \ntelecommunications market. Restrictions on FDI are a significant disincentive to investment by US service \nproviders seeking to provide seamless, global services to their multinational enterprise custo mers.  \n \nThailand’s market entry restrictions are a significant disincentive to investment by US service providers seeking \nto provide seamless, global services to their multinational enterprise customers. USCIB therefore urges USTR to \nencourage Thailand to broaden the list of telecommunications services that can be provided by foreign carriers.  \n \nComputer Crime Act  \n \nCertain industries have previously raised concerns with  aspects of  the Computer Crime Act, amended in 2016.  In \nNovember 2019, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society established an Anti -Fake News Center to combat \nwhat is considered “false and misleading” in violation of the Computer Crimes Act.60 It is important that these \ntypes of authorities not be used to restrict online and press freedom.  \n \nCybersecurity Law  \n \nIn 2019, Thailand passed a controversial Cybersecurity Law.  Industry has criticized the law due to provisions that \nenable government surveillance.61 Under the  law, officials are granted authority to “search and seize data and \nequipment in cases that are deemed issues of national emergency.”62 This could “enable internet traffic monitoring \nand access to private data, including communications, without a court order.”63 \n \nFinancial Services  \n \nThailand has an opportunity to improve the banking sector environment through eliminating discriminatory \ntreatment and making improvements toward the ease of doing business.  Banks are limited in the number of \nlicenses for bank branches and subsidiaries. In practice, discretion by the Bank of Thailand means little access for \nforeign banks. For example, foreign banks typically must acquire an existing bank to participate in the market and \nis limited to 25 percent ownership. The Bank of Thailand has discretion  to raise the equity participation by the \nforeign bank. Steps that Thai authorities should consider in the banking sector to improve the business climate \ninclude the elimination of wet signatures in order to enable end to end digital client onboarding and permitting \nbank branches to use sales outlets under full y owned subsidiaries and partner sales outlets to be used as data \ncollection points for account opening. Taking these steps recognizes the changes in the ways banks serve their \ncustomers and clients to meet their personal and business financial goals.   \n \n \n60 Freedom on the Net 2020: Thailand  (2020), https://freedomhouse.org/country/thailand/freedom -net/2020  \n61 See Asia Internet Coalition Statement, Feb. 28, 2019, https://aicasia.org/wp -content/uploads/2019/03/AICStatement_Thailand -Cybersecurity -\nLaw_28 -Feb-2019.pdf (“Protecting online security is a top priority, however the Law’s ambiguously defined scope, vague lan guage and lack of \nsafeguards raises serious privacy concerns for both individuals and businesses, especially provisions that allow overreaching  authority to search and \nseize data and electronic equipment without proper legal oversight. This would give the regime sweeping powers to monitor online traffic in the name \nof an emergency or as a preventive measure, potentially compromising private and corporate data.”).  \n62 Thailand Passes Controversial Cybersecurity Law , TECHCRUNCH  (Feb. 28, 2019), https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/thailand -passes -\ncontroversial -cybersecurity -law/.  \n63 Id.  \n \n 122 \nThailand Payment Systems Act  \n \nThe Thailand Payment Systems Act mandates domestic processing of domestic debit card transactions for debit \ncards issued in Thailand, highlighting cost savings that would be yielded by domestic processing, vs offshore \nprocessing.  This hinders the evolution of Thailand’s payment ecosystem, obstructing alignment with international \nstandards, and limits consumer access to innovative payment solutions, secure and resilient global networks - \nsimultaneously running counter to the Bank of  Thailand's (BOT) policy objectives to ensure a future -proof, secure, \nefficient, and resilient payment ecosystem. In Aug 2024, the BOT issued a consultation seeking suggestions to \nrevise the Payment Systems Act.  \n \nCustoms  \n \nDespite regular complaints from the United States and a chorus of other countries, Thailand continues to subject \nforeign companies to discriminatory customs procedures that are motivated in large measure by a “reward” system \nthat creates inherent conflicts  of interest for Thai government officials with respect to customs valuations. This is \na stark non -tariff barrier to exports to Thailand. This system has led to baseless criminal charges, in contravention \nof controlling Thai law and judicial rulings, again st companies and individuals.  While improvements were made \nto the Thai Customs legislation and the potential fines and available rewards significantly reduced, this continues \nto provide an incentive for corruption and false charges.  \n \nFood Marketing  \n \nThailand’s National  Act on Control of Marketing of Food for Infants and Young Children and Related Products \n(“the Act”)  raises serious concerns about  restrictions on formula and milk products for children up to three years \nof age, expanding previous restrictions on formula for infants under twelve months.  The Act  expand s existing \nrestrictions to cover a much broader range of promotional, advertising, educational, labeling and branding \nactivities involving products that provide important nutrition for young children.  The Act also adds criminal \npenalties such as imprisonment for non -compliance and establishes a committee of government and non -\ngovernment representatives with non -transparent oversight and enforcement powers.  \n \nThe law raises serious trade and public health concerns, as it:  \n \n• Discriminates against imported products by targeting them for these restrictions while exempting local \nproducts commonly consumed by older infants and young children.   \n• Ignores less trade -restrictive alternative policy measures that would better achieve Thailand’s stated goal \nof increased breastfeeding rates .  \n• Restricts the use of trademarked brand names, logos, symbols , and packaging, thereby denying consumers \naccess to important information to identify reputable products that are safe and effective and increasing \nthe risk that counterfeit products could enter the supply chain.   \n \nIt diverges without scientific justification from relevant international standards, specifically those of the Codex \nAlimentarius, and from the World Health Organization Code of Marketing of Breast -Milk Substitutes, and it has \ngenerated concerns by leading me dical societies in Thailand, including the Royal College of Pediatricians.  The \nAct is inconsistent with Thailand’s obligations under the WTO TBT and TRIPS Agreements and would deny Thai \nconsumers and healthcare providers access to important information t hat would enable them to identify reputable, \nsafe products and to make informed decisions about nutrition for young children.  \n \n   \n \n 123 \nTURKEY  \n \nData Localization  \n \nA 2019 Presidential Circular  on Information and Communication Security Measures introduced localization \nrequirements on government workloads deemed “strategic .” In 2020, the Digital Transformation Office published \nGuidelines clarifying that the scope of the localization requirements included  critical information and data ; \nhowever, the loosely  defined residency obligations under the Presidential Circular remains  a regulatory challenge  \nas the legislation overrides  the DTO Guidelines. Strict data localization also applies in the financial services \nsector , where the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency requires primary and secondary information \nsystems to be hosted in Turkey. The Central Bank of Turkey implements similar restrictions on cloud outsourcing \nand prohibits the use of cloud for certain workloads. The Turkish Data Protection Law (DPL) permits the transfers \nof personal information to jurisdictions deemed adequate, subject to the explicit consent of the data subject or \nafter obtaining permission from the data protection authority (KVKK). However, Turk ey has not yet decided on \ncountries deemed adequate for international transfers. The adequacy decision has been postponed several times \nsince 2021; with the latest timeline for the announcement being Q4 2024.  \n \nThe March 2024 amendments to the Law on the Protection of Personal Data marked progress in aligning Turkey \nwith GDPR standards. These changes introduced mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses to ease cross -\nborder data transfers. Before these amend ments, transferring data abroad from Turkey was constrained by \nstringent requirements. Although the latest changes have made the regulatory environment more lenient, \nparticularly in terms of data transfers abroad, full compliance with EU legislation remain s incomplete.  \n \nDigital Services Tax  \n \nTurkey’s DST imposes a tax on revenue generated from a broad range of digital services offered in Turkey, \nincluding digital advertising, digital content sales, and digital platform services. The current tax rate is 7.5%, but \nthe Turkish President has the u nilateral authority to increase that rate up to 15%, or to decrease it as low as 1%. \nThe DST only applies to companies that generate revenues from covered digital services of at least: (i) TRY 20 \nmillion (about €2 million) in Turkey; and (ii) €750 million globally. USCIB  encourages USTR to continue \nworking with Turkey to address the discrimination against U.S. companies under Turkey’s DST.  \n \nUGANDA  \n \nUgand a’s National Local Bill, 2019 imposes  local content requirements on any person or entity engaged in an \nactivity in which public money is used or utilizes Uganda’s national resources or conducts an activity requiring a \nlicense. It requires the employment of Ugandan citizen in all possible cases and for entities to prioritize the use of \nUgandan goods and services in procurement. Furthermore, the purchase of certain goods and services, including \nall professional services, computer an d related services, and oth ers are required to be reserved for Ugandan \ncitizens and entities. If the Ugandan preference requirements cannot be met, entities will have to seek an \nexemption from the Ministry of Finance and in some cases, utilize firms that have entered into a joint ve nture \nwith a Ugandan company or citizen.  \n \n   \n \n 124 \nThis law discourages greater investment into Uganda and threatens the business of several multinationals in \ncountry by mandating a shift from the global platforms that many use to operate in Uganda efficiently and \neffectively . Additionally, this law may run afoul of Uganda’s obligations as a member of the WTO, East African \nCommunity (EAC), and the African Continental Free Trade Area.  \n \nUKRAINE  \n \nCloud Law, Public Procurement Law, Public Electronic Registers Law, Information Protection Law, Law on \nProtection of Personal Data, National Bank of Ukraine Regulations  \n \nUkraine’s Martial Law (a special legal regime introduced in February 2022 after Russia’s invasion) temporarily \nsuspended restrictions on the use of public cloud services by the public sector and certain private sector entities \n(e.g., banks). This allowed t he Ukrainian Government to safeguard its data with support from US CSPs. However, \nUkraine’s cloud adoption may be hampered once the Martial Law is withdrawn, as its outdated legislation poses \nchallenges for both US CSPs and their Ukrainian customers. Key c oncerns regarding the legislation include: (i) a \nlack of recognition of international cybersecurity standards (e.g. ISO) obtained by CSPs, and a preference for \nlocal technical requirements; (ii) the exclusive application of Ukrainian law to govern cloud se rvice agreements, \nwhich is incompatible with the cross -border nature of cloud services; (iii) restrictions on the ability of non -\nUkrainian CSPs to provide services to public institutions involving the processing of personal data; (iv) \nrequirements to re -migrate certain categories of data to Ukraine (temporarily allowed by the Martial Law to be \nstored abroad); and (v) a lack of clear data classification regulations.  \n \nDigital Payment Services  \n \nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) recently started a technical testing project assessing the banks’ ability to \nswitch a domestic transaction initiated with a payment card bearing a brand of an international payment system \nthrough a national switch, which is owned and operated by the NBU. Currently, such transactions are switched \nby the infrastructure owned by the operators of the relevant electronic payment systems (EPS) located outside of \nUkraine. The NBU’s position is that such an emergency arrangement i s designed to enable the clients of the \nrelevant Ukrainian financial institutions – members of the above -mentioned systems – to have access to their \npayment card accounts in case of potential long -term disruption of connection (2 -3 days) between the releva nt \nfinancial institutions and the respective international payment systems. We are concerned about the lack of a clear \nprocess to conduct the proposed technical testing. From the perspective of an operator of the EPS, this could be \ncarried out (i) either b y client -banks sharing their proprietary data with the NBU or (ii) the domestic switch would \nneed to get certified by the relevant operator of the EPS to be able to “accept” its proprietary formats. The NBU \ndoes not currently intend to introduce a dedicate d legal framework for the above “emergency switch \narrangement”, which may result in a legal uncertainty on the payments market whereby in the absence of a clear \nregulatory framework, the relevant financial institutions might randomly start migration to the  domestic switch \nbeyond an “emergency” scenario. In such a case, this could drastically change the existing payments ecosystem \nand present some significant challenges for the EPS operating model.  \n \nUNITED KINGDOM  \n \nTelecommunications (Security) Act 2021 – Localization Requirements  \n \nThe UK Government  issued its final Secondary Regulations and Code of Practice under the Telecommunications \n(Security) Act 2021.  The two documents sit under the overall framework of the Act and provide a set of 13 duties \nfor telecoms network and service providers, along wit h a detailed list of 260 technical measures in the Code of  \n \n 125 \nPractice which providers should follow to demonstrate compliance.  While  the Regulations are effective from \nOctober 1, 2022, the Code of Practice has staggered implementation dates starting on March  31, 2025.   \n \nMost concerning are certain localization requirements for people, data, and systems inside the UK.  Specifically,  \nthe following clauses of the draft Regulations requires all provider to:  \n \n• Take appropriate and proportionate measures to identify risks of security compromises without the \nreliance on persons, equipment,  or stored data from outside the UK.64 \n• Identify and mitigate risks of security comprises caused by use of monitoring and analysis tools which are \nnot located in the UK.65 \n• Create and retain an online (and where proportionate an offline) copy of information necessary to maintain \nthe normal operation of the public electronic communications network or public electronic \ncommunications service within the UK and  replace regularly.66 \n \nThese legally binding regulations are supplemented by further guidance in the Code of Practice, including a \nwhole section of the Code of Practice dedicated to National Resilience, which includes transferring functions to \nthe UK should international connect ivity fail.  \n \nSuch localization measures put US-telecoms providers at a disadvantage compared to their local counterparts. \nNot only would they increase costs and burden for US -telecoms providers, but it  may also have a detrimental \nimpact on the performance of security functions such as cross -border threat monitoring and “follow the sun” \nsupport services for customers. It may also impact on UK -based telecoms providers from purchasing global or \ncloud servi ces from US-based companies e.g. , cloud storage, cloud -based or remo te security analytics etc.  \n \nNational Security and Investment Act  \n \nThe National Security and Investment Act 2021 allows the government to scrutinise and intervene in certain \nacquisitions made by anyone, including businesses and investors, that could harm the UK’s national security.  \n \nThe regime falls into two parts: (a) a mandatory regime; and (b) a voluntary regime. The mandatory regime \nrequires qualifying transactions to be notified for approval before they take place. The voluntary regime allows \nparties to submit transactions for ap proval – and also allows deals to be called -in retrospectively even if not \nvoluntarily notified. Notifications are made to the Investment Security Unit (ISU) (within the Department for \nBusiness, Energy,  and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)), which operates the r egime on a day -to-basis, although under \nthe Act it is strictly the Secretary of State for BEIS who decides whether to call -in a transaction and the outcome \nof any review.   \n \nSubject to certain criteria67, companies are legally required to tell the government about acquisitions of certain \nentities in 17 sensitive areas of the economy (called ‘notifiable acquisitions’). The 17 areas of the economy include \nnotably AI, Communications, Data Infrastructure, Cri tical Suppliers to Government, suppliers to Emergency \nServices, etc .68 \n \n  \n \n64 Section 3(3)(f)  \n65 Section 5(2)  \n66 Section 9(2)(a)  and (b) \n67 See Chapter 2 of the NSI Act . They include crossing ownership thresholds (trigger event), connection with the UK, etc.  \n68 Full list here.   \n \n 126 \nTo fall within the regime the target entity or asset must be from, in or have a sufficient connection with the UK, \nand the Act has extra -territorial effect. A qualifying entity must carry on activities in the UK or supply goods or \nservices to people in the  UK, and a qualifying asset must be used in connection with activities carried on in the \nUK or the supply of goods or services to people in the UK.  \n \nIf a deal requiring mandatory notification is not approved the transaction will be legally void. In addition, there \nare civil and criminal penalties, including potential daily penalties for ongoing breaches. Completing a transaction \nthat is subject to mand atory notification without approval will risk a penalty of up to 5 per cent of group worldwide \nturnover or £10 million (whichever is higher), and imprisonment for individuals for up to five years.  \n \nUltimately, for a transaction to be significantly delayed, denied approval,  or even unwound, the acquirer needs to \nraise important national security concerns. The Government has made it clear that it is affiliations to a hostile \nparty rather than foreign nationality in itself or relationships with foreign powers is problematic. While the odds \nthat the Government will express concerns about US -companies being linked to hostile activity towards the UK \nare low, the Act means that investment decisions in the UK  are subject to more uncertainty and potential delays.  \n \nDigital Trade and Financial Services  \n \nWe urge USTR to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK that incorporates high -standard rules for digital \ntrade and financial services.  \n \nURUGUAY  \n \nMeasures that single -out and seek to limit a specific provider are part of a general approach towards limiting \nforeign investors’ participation in the Uruguayan telecommunications market and restricting competitive \nopportunities. In line with that approach , the Uruguayan government revoked America Movil’s lice nse to provide \npay-TV services in the country twice already and also included a provision in the Media Law (article 106) which \nstates that new audiovisual service licensees can no longer be an affiliat e of a foreign company . USCIB urges \nUSTR to encourage Uruguayan authorities to revoke the existing line -of-business restrictions.  \n \nNutrition Labeling  \n \nUruguay notified the WTO in 2017 proposals  to impose front of package stop sign labels on foods exceeding set \nlevels for fat, saturated fat, sodium, and sugar content.  These stop -sign labels are modeled on Chile’s stop sign \nlabels, about which serious concerns have been raised as they are unjustified warning statements that fail to \nconsider total dietary intake or the amount and frequency of the food’s consumption.   \n \nUSCIB remains concerned that such a label ling scheme is not based on sound science, deviates from international \nstandards, unjustifiably  alarms and confuses consumers, denigrates the vast majority of food and beverage \nproducts, and is unlikely to contribute meaningful improvements to public health.   \n \nVIETNAM  \n \nCybersecurity Law  \n \nUpdates to decree 53/2022/ND -CP became effective on October 1, 2022 - with “uncertainty around the scope of \nspecific requirements for businesses.” Notably, foreign enterprises working in certain industries, including online \npayment, must store the followin g data in Vietnam ONLY IF (i) their services are used to commit illegal  \n \n 127 \ncybersecurity activities AND (ii) they fail to comply with written requests by the management agencies of the \nMinistry of Public Security (MPS) for coordination in prevention, investigation and handling of violations. All \ndomestic companies, including fore ign-invested subsidiaries in Vietnam, must store a copy of Vietnamese user \ndata on servers located within Vietnam.  \n \nThe Ministry of Public Security is drafting a Decree on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Cybersecurity \nLaws that will impose fines and administrative penalties (including “technical measures,” such as bandwidth \nlimits and blocking of sites) for v iolations of regulations concerning cybersecurity, personal data protection, \ninformation security, and network protection.  \n \nUpdate to July 2023 draft measure to replace Decrees 72 and 27 removes note regarding insufficient due process \nfor companies providing “public information across the border” and other requirements.  \n \nDraft Data Law  \n \nThe draft Data Law has duplications with the draft PDPD Law on regulations on personal data governance. It \nintroduces new provisions on categories of data and data assessment requirements and borrows vague definitions \nof “important data” and “core data” fr om China’s Data Security Law that can have chilling effects on foreign \ninvestors in Vietnam. The draft Law imposes onerous obligations on individuals and organizations for \nauthenticating and ensuring the accuracy of created data as well as approvals for cr oss border transfers of \nimportant and core data. The draft Data Law proposes licensing and regulating data products and services such as \ndata intermediary, data analysis and aggregation products and services, and data exchange services. An \nimplication of s uch requirements is that offshore enterprises not incorporated or registered in Vietnam would not \nbe allowed to offer any of the above service to Vietnamese customers.  \n \nDraft Digital Technology Industry Law  \n \nThe draft Digital Technology Industry (DTI) Law sets up a legal framework for digital technology industry (DTI), \nincluding but not limited to cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain, artificial reality (AR), and \nvirtual reality (VR). The broad definition of \"digital technology\" encompassing diverse and rapidly evolving \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and blockchain raises concerns about the potential for \noverly prescriptive regulations. The draft law’s intentio n of prioritizing investment, lease and procurement of \ndomestically produced digital technology products and services may result in unfair treatment of the foreign \nbusinesses. The draft law assigns Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) to promul gate technical \nregulations and regulations on the compulsory application of international, regional, foreign and national \nstandards in the digital technology industry, which might lead to the risk of undermining global commerce and \nhamper technology evolut ion as well as creating barriers for local organization in most up -to-date technologies.  \n \nPersonal Data Protection Decree  \n \nVietnam’s Personal Data Protection Decree 13/2023/ND -CP, which went into effect on July 1, 2023, does not \nprovide a clear scope regarding which industries or businesses will be subject to it. Decree 13 requires personal \ndata controllers, processors, and tr ansferers to prepare, make available for inspection and submit to MPS a dossier \nfor assessment of the impact of personal data processing and overseas transferring.  \n \n   \n \n 128 \nTelecommunications Services  \n \nVietnam permits foreign participation in the telecommunications sector, with varying equity limitations \ndepending on the sub -sector. According to the Law on Telecommunications (Telecom Law) 41/2009/QH12, for \ndomestic companies that provide basic telecommun ication services with infrastructure, foreign ownership is \ngenerally capped at 49 percent; for companies that supply telecommunications services without infrastructure, \nforeign ownership is capped at 65 percent. Vietnam allows foreign ownership of up to 70  percent for virtual \nprivate network (VPN) services suppliers. Facilities -based operators are required to be state -controlled firms, \nmeaning that the state, through the relevant line ministry, must hold 51 percent or more of equity.  \n  \nThe revised Telecom Law was passed by Vietnam’s National Assembly on November 24, 2023,  with a “light \ntouch” regime for OTT, data center and cloud services. The Ministry of Information and Telecommunications \n(MIC) has drafted the Decree implementing the Telecom Law and sought industry’s input . The final draft is under \nfinal review by the Government Office.  \n \nCivil Cryptography Trading and Import License Requirements  \n \nThe Government Cipher Committee (GCC) requires that the importation and exportation of any product \ncontaining cryptographic functionality obtain specific permits and licenses. Importers  and Exporters  importing \nand exporting  IT products with regulated data encryption capabilities must obtain Cryptography Trading License \n(“CTL”) and Cryptography Import License (“CIL”). Time taken to obtain CTLs and CILs are inordinately long – \ntaking months to obtain. They also require detailed  information alongside the appli cation, including detailed \nproduct information, defined technical plans, information regarding the cryptographic function of the equipment, \ninformation regarding local personnel, as well as additional information. In implementation of these requirements, \ncompanies often experience delays and inconsistent/non -transparent approval or rejection processes by GCC. \nThese burdensome requirements, and the required routine follow -ups, limit the ability for companies investing in \nVietnam to import critical hardware. The new regulation (Circular 23/2022/TT -BQP of Ministry of Defense) for \ncryptographic certification requirement was passed in 2022, but the Vietnamese government is still working \nthrough the enforcement mechanism, which will likely introduce additional bur dens to importers once it comes \ninto force although its degree of complexity is unclear at this time.  \n \nDecree 85 on E -commerce  \n \nOn September 25, 2021, the government issued Decree 85 on E -commerce, broadening its scope to include cross -\nborder platforms without a local presence in Vietnam (including websites in Vietnamese language or exceeding \n100,000 transactions per year). The Dec ree entered into effect January 2022.  \n \nRestrictions to Cloud Services   \n \nVietnam’s Prime Minister signed Decision 749/QD -TTg in 2020 , announcing the country’s National Digital \nTransformation Strategy by 2025.69 The Decree calls for the creation of technical and non -technical measures to \ncontrol cross -border digital platforms.  \n \n  \n \n69 See https://vanbanphapluat.co/decision -749-qd-ttg-2020 -introducing -program -for-national -digital -transformation.   \n \n 129 \nThe Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has subsequently issued Decisions 1145 and 783 to \nannounce a local cloud standard and cloud framework, respectively, which set forward cloud technical standards \nand considerations for state agencies and smart cities projects in favor of local private cloud use.70 These decisions \naim to create a preferential framework for domestic cloud service providers.  The MIC Minister has stated a desire \nfor Vietnamese firms to attain a stronger hold in cloud computing and digitalization infrastructures, as they have \nwith physical networks.71 While these standards are technically voluntary, in practice, these standards are \nexpected to be adopted by the Vietnamese public sector.  \n \nDigital Taxation  \n \nThe Tax Administration Law taxes cross -border e -commerce and other digital services.72 Circular 80 ,73 providing \nguidance on Law on Tax Administration and its Decree 126 , added a requirement for foreign digital service/e -\ncommerce suppliers without a permanent establishment in Vietnam, to directly register and pay tax to the tax \nauthorities. If the foreign service providers do not register, service buyers (or commercial ban ks in case of \nindividual buyers) will withhold tax from their payment to foreign suppliers at deemed tax rates. The    law \nprescribes the above digital suppliers to file dossiers for applying Double Tax Treaty at the same time as filing \nquarterly tax retur ns, but it is unclear how the suppliers, of whom the sales revenue is withheld by their buyers or \ncommercial banks in the country would claim the tax treaty’s benefits. Th ese onerous procedures coupled with \nthe deemed tax rates (Corporate Income Tax and Value Added Tax) further complicate tax obligations for cross -\nborder service providers and conflict with international taxation rules.  This tax is explicitly discriminatory, as it \noperates as a tariff on foreign -provided digital goods and services. Unilatera l taxes by Vietnam put US companies \nat risk of double taxation and create tax compliance burdens.  \n \nTelecommunications Services  \n \nVietnam  Law on Telecommunications , as amended , redefines value -added telecommunication service so as to \nextend regulatory coverage intended for traditional telecommunications service providers to in -country and cross -\nborder suppliers of cloud computing services, data center colocation services, and ove r-the-top Internet -enabled \nservices. Data centers were defined to be as a type of telecommunications facility. The regulatory expansion of \nthe telco laws exposes future risks that limitation may be reinstated in the future in its implementing decree or \nother relevant legislations. This , along with foreign investment limits  among others,  have increased uncertainty \naround future investments in Vietnam’s traditionally unrestricted computer services sector.  \n \nTechnical Barriers to Enforce Digital Protectionism  \n \nVietnam’s Decision 749/QD -TTg of 2020 , announced  the country’s National Digital Transformation Strategy, \nand called  for the introduction of technical and non -technical measures to control cross -border digital platforms. \nThe Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has subsequently issued Decisions 1145 and 783 which \nsets out technical standards and consideratio ns for the use of cloud services by state agencies and smart cities \nprojects that favor local private cloud use. These decisions clearly inte nd to create a preferential framework for \nlocal CSPs, creating de facto market access barriers. Furthermore, the MIC Minister has made public statements \n \n70 Vietnam Issues Guidelines on Cloud Computing for E -Government Deployment , LEXOLOGY  (Apr. 15, 2020), \nhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e567a057 -5b54 -4760 -bcd9 -937ca888773f.  \n71 Ministry Launches Digital Transformation Campaign , VIETNAM NET (May 23, 2020), https://vietnamnet.vn/en/sci -tech-environment/ministry -\nlaunches -digital -transformation -campaign -643379.html.  \n72 Vietnam’s Tax Administration Law Takes Effect , R GLOBAL  (Aug. 7, 2020), https://www.irglobal.com/article/vietnams -tax-administration -law-\ntakes -effect -in-july-2020 -0f67/.  \n73 See https://thuvienphapluat.vn/tintuc/vn/thoi -su-phap -luat/chinh -sach-moi/37945/thong -tu-80-2021 -tt-btc-huong -dan-luat-quan -ly-thue-nd-126-\n2020   \n \n 130 \nnoting that “as Vietnamese firms are getting stronger hold of physical networks, [Vietnam] must do the same for \ncloud computing and digitalization infrastructures [… ]” (1). While these standards are technically “voluntary,” in \npractice, this will be adopted by the Vietnamese public sector as if it is mandatory.  \n \nLicensing Requirement for Banks  \n \nUpdates to Decree 52/2024/ND -CP, became effective on July 1, 2024 – it introduces a new licensing requirement \nfor banks and financial switching and electronic clearing service providers to connect with international payment \nnetworks, including U.S. electro nic payments companies. Specifically, the existing clients must meet specific \nrequirements and obtain State Bank of Vietnam’s (SBV) approval/license to connect with U.S. electronic \npayments companies within a transition period of 24 months. New clients mus t obtain the approval/license before \nthe connection. These measures would appear to also require NAPAS (a financial switching and electronic \nclearing service provider) to obtain written approvals from the SBV to connect to U.S. electronic payments \ncompanie s. \n \nThe SBV issued Circular 18/2024/TT -NHNN, which replaces Circulars 19 and 28. The domestic routing mandate \nremains; specifically, Card Present domestic transactions of U.S. electronic payments companies must be routed \nvia NAPAS.  \n \nElectronic Transactions Law  \n \nUpdate to Electronic Transactions Law No. 20/2023/WH15 remains ambiguous concerning compliance \nobligations.  \n \nDraft Decree on Business Licensing Requirements for Information Security Products and Services  \n \nVietnam should consider aligning its approach to cybersecurity along the lines of international best practice, which \ncreates a flexible and market driven approach based on risk management.  Excessive government regulation of \nthese services may make ultimately make it harder for Vietnam’s economy to benefit from the latest cybersecurity \nproducts and services.   \n \nMedia and Entertainment Services  \n \nVietnam maintains a variety of discriminatory and distortive policies , including a screen quota of 20 percent; a \nbroadcast quota of 50 percent , a prohibition on foreign content during prime time, and a requirement that 30 \npercent  of air time be devoted to Vietnamese feature films; restrictions on foreign investment; an opaque and \nuncertai n censorship review process; 30 percent  of total channels limit on foreign channels for pay TV providers; \ndiscriminatory requirements on advertisements on pay TV channels; and local agent requirements for pay TV.   \n \nVietnam has doubled down on these measures in a Cinema Law. The Ministry of Culture, Sport, and Tourism \n(MCST) is currently drafting a decree detailing a number of articles in the law.  The latest draft of the decree \nreinforces a 30% local content quota, w hile imposing new licensing and film rating requirements, tight timelines \nfor compliance with takedown requests, user reports, and cinema fund contribution requirements.  \n \n   \n \n 131 \nOTT VOD Services  \n \nVietnamese  OTT streaming services are subject to the onerous regulations for broadcast and pay TV.  The \nAuthority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information (ABEI) continues to insist on a licensing requirement to \nregulate content on OCC platforms. Draft  Decree 6  imposes unreasonable and unworkable provisions on online \ncurated content (OCC) services allowing for market access restrictions, including FDI limits . In 2022, Vietnam \nissued Decree 71/2022/ND -CP, which  amend ed Decree 6 to include cross -border OTT services within its scope \nand require d OTT service providers to set up local entities and impose licensing/registration requirements on these \nproviders.  \n \nBurdensome Product Registration Renewals  \n \nVietnam currently requires pharmaceutical firms to apply for registration renewals or “visas” every five years.  \nRenewing submissions every five years creates a significant administrative burden since the process to obtain or \nrenew a product visa can take from 18 -24 months,  and it is not possible to submit a dossier for renewal until \ntwelve months before the expiry of the existing registration. These delays and restrictions can lead to “off -visa” \nperiods, during which importation and promotion of the product is not typically  permitted – resulting in shortages \nfor hospitals and patients – and medical education activities are significantly restricted.  USCIB members are \nencouraged that the Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV) has outlined a process for reducing the visa review \ntimeline. More importantly, the 5-year visa extension process - introduced in the Pharmaceutical Law in 2016 – \nthough not yet implemented, may reduce the administrative burden.   \n \nNevertheless, the review process, especially for new drug application dossiers including clinical or bioequivalence \ndata is unclear and lengthy, leading to limited and delayed access of Vietnamese patients to innovative medicines.  \n \n   \n \n 132 \nCONCLUSION  \n \nUSCIB powers the success of US business across the globe. Our members include US -based companies and \nprofessional services firms from every sector of the economy, with operations in every region of the world. As \nthe US affiliate of leading international bu siness organizations including Business at OECD (BIAC), The \nInternational Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and The International Organization of Employers (IOE), USCIB \nadvances the US business perspective to policymakers and regulatory authorities worldwide and works to \nfacilitate commerce, support sustainable development, and build trust in multilateral systems. USCIB is also the \nnational guaranteeing and issuing association for ATA Carnets, a unified international customs documents that \nallows for the temporary  importation of various types of goods into a foreign country without paying duties or \ntaxes.  \n \nUSCIB appreciates the efforts of the Office of the United States Trade Representative through the Trade Policy \nStaff Committee (TPSC), publishing each year the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers \n(NTE Report) to help advance an open sy stem of world trade, finance , and investment, where business can flourish \nand contribute to economic growth, human welfare , and environmental protection.

AdvaMed’s member companies produce the innovations that are transforming healthcare through earlier disease detect ion, less invasive procedures and more effective \ntreatments.  AdvaMed has more than 600 member companies, ranging from the largest to the smallest \nmedical technology innovators and manufacturers. \n \nThe AdvaMed Medical Imaging Division represents the manufacturers of medical imaging equipment, \nincluding, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical X -Ray equipment, computed tomography (CT) \nscanners, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, radiopharmaceuticals, and imaging information systems. Division of Dockets Management (HFA -305)      FDA-2019- D-3805- 0073  \nDecember  19, 202 4 \nPage 2 of 18 \n \n \n \n \nOur members have introduced innovative medical imaging technologies to the market, and they play an \nessential role in our nation’s health care infrastructure and the care pathways of screening, staging, \nevaluating, managing, and effectively treating patients with cancer, heart disease, neurological \ndegeneration, COVID -19, and numerous other medical condi tions.  \n \nGENERAL COMMENTS  \nWe appreciate FDA reissuing the draft guidance and the two accompanying documents to reflect the now \npermanent nature of the ASCA program and lessons learned during the pilot stage of the program. We \nsupport FDA use of international voluntary consensus standards to meet regulatory requirements, \nincluding through the ASCA program.  \nUse of standards to meet regulatory requirements has many benefits to all parties, including introducing \nefficiencies for FDA , the medical device industry, and patients  by reducing duplication, minimizing \nunnecessary costs and delays in patient access to innovative new devices, and furthering efforts to \nharmonize global medical technology regulations.  \nAdvaMed and AdvaMed Imaging have actively followed the development of ASCA and provided input \nsince the inception of the pilot.  We believe there is significant promise in the program, and our \ncomments are designed to help achieve that promise now that the  pilot is a permanent program.  \n \nASCA PROGRAM GUIDANCE:  \n FDA Should only Request the Full Test Report in the Rarest of Circumstances  \n \nWe appreciated past FDA statements recommending that developers not submit the complete testing \nreport.  However, we have heard concerns by those that have used ASCA that the FDA reviewer \nrequested the complete test report, and there may be a disconnect be tween standards policy staff that \nrecommend only the summary report and the reviewers requesting the complete testing report.  We \nunderstand that full testing reports are requested in approximately 5% of reviews.  Although 5 percent \nmay seem low, in our vi ew, it is still too high.  \n \nWe believe a successful program would result in acceptance by FDA of the summary report without \nsubstantive review by FDA except as part of a periodic quality audit or if FDA becomes aware of new information materially relevant to safety and/or effectivene ss.  We would like to see FDA accept the \nreferenced standards that are part of the program entirely on the presentation of a Declaration of \nConformity (DoC) and the summary report, with no additional data, including request for a full test \nreport, or evaluation during a submission review.  We seek very few, if any, additional information \nrequests related to accredited reports/certifications and/or conformance to the cited standard.   \n \nThe success of the program depends on a developer’s confidence that FDA will rely on the summary \nreport, which will speed the review. While we recognize that there will be rare circumstances as  \n Division of Dockets Management (HFA -305)      FDA-2019- D-3805- 0073  \nDecember  19, 202 4 \nPage 3 of 18 \n \n \n \n \nmentioned above where FDA needs the full report, this should be exceedingly rare. FDA noted during  \nthe public workshop this spring that it is looking to encourage use of the program, and anything FDA  can \ndo to reduce the instances in which it requests the complete report will promote usage.  \n \nAs an overall theme of predictability, it would be helpful to understand the period of time for which FDA \nwill continue to accept a summary report, for instance a year. The more a developer knows that \nexpectations will not change, the more valuable the program will be to developers. \n \nFDA Should Fully Recognize Standards as Much as Possible  \n \nStandards identified as “partially recognized” on a Supplementary Information Sheet may require a \nmanufacturer to generate two test reports, an ASCA -usable test report and another test report that tests to \nthe entire standard to satisfy the rest of the world.  This need for two test reports requires extra expense \nand time, which may negatively influence use of the ASCA program.  As a general recommendation we encourage FDA to fully recognize standards as much as possible with robust scientific justifications for \nnot fully recognizing the standard, in furtherance of global harmonization.  \n \nAdditional Granularity in Reporting on ASCA by Standard Type would Provide Helpful Clarity  \n \nThe MDUFA IV commitment letter included reporting obligations FDA would provide on the success of \nthe program; MDUFA V, which made the pilot a permanent program, includes ongoing reporting \ncommitments. We believe FDA has faithfully met the applicable repor ting commitments. However, \nadditional granularity in reporting would be helpful. In particular, we request that all metrics be provided \nat the level of the type of standard, e.g., reported for the biocompatibility standards with separate \nnumbers for the basic safety standards. This will help FDA and industry better identify trends and opportunities for improvements that may be due to the specific standards versus the overall progra m. \n \nFDA S hould be M indful in the Language it U ses to D escribe Laboratories and Manufacturers \nParticipating in the P rogram, C onsistent with the V oluntary N ature of the P rogram.  \n \nDuring the public hearing this spring, FDA statements suggested that the laboratories that participate in \nASCA are of better quality, and devices using ASCA will be safer, than those that do not participate in the program. We see remnants of this theme in the language in this draft guidance . \n \nWe respectfully reiterate our request that FDA be mindful in describing the program and avoid any \nsuggestion that the laboratories/device manufacturers that elect not to participate in the program are \nsomehow of lesser caliber than the ones that opt to participate.  \n \nParticipation in the program, similar to a certification seal, provides confidence that the laboratory has met \ncertain criteria established by FDA. However, ASCA is a voluntary program and neither laboratories nor \ndevelopers are obligated to participate and may decide in good faith not to participate.  FDA should be careful that its language does not unintentionally imply that participation is a requisite to quality.  \n \n Division of Dockets Management (HFA -305)      FDA-2019- D-3805- 0073  \nDecember  19, 202 4 \nPage 4 of 18 \n \n \n \n \nFDA Should Notify the Public of Suspensions  \nWhile we appreciate that the FDA intends to update its website for testing laboratories whose ASCA \nAccreditation is withdrawn, manufacturers and the public should be notified of suspensions to provide \ntransparency to potentially fraudulent activity at test ing laboratories.  \nIn addition, we reiterate our prior recommendation that FDA ensure that any updates FDA -recognized \nstandards, including updates to ASCA, are emailed to subscribers of a dedicated listserve.  \n \nBIOCOMPATIBILITY STANDARDS SPECIFIC INFORMATION DOCUMENT  \n \nWe appreciate FDA’s support and clear goal of establishing more complete and consistent guidance for \nbiocompatibility testing.  AdvaMed appreciates FDA (or Agency) efforts to enhance the predictability and \nconsistency in biocompatibility assessment.  These  efforts are critical to ensure timely patient access to \nlife-saving and life -changing technologies that are transforming healthcare through earlier disease \ndetection, less invasive procedures, and more effective treatments.  Biocompatibility continues to be a priority issue to ensure an overall risk management and least burdensome approach.   \n \nThe guidance as drafted provides much needed clarity and we look forward to working with FDA and other partners toward achieving sustainable progress.  We also appreciate that FDA has added \nbiocompatibility standards to the ASCA program.  \n \nIn addition to the content provided in the draft, we highlight the need for additional clarity on the \naccreditation process and specifying responsibility for the testing.  We recommend FDA clearly indicate \nin the guidance that:  \n \nSponsors are responsible for determining the appropriate testing in collaboration with the testing laboratory.  Accordingly;  \n \nThe accreditation process should be inclusive of appropriate test methods, including alternative in vitro  \ntesting, in pursuance of clinical relevance, flexibility, least -burdensome principles, and benefit -risk \napproach.   \n \nOptimally, laboratories should be eligible/accredited in all testing modalities that may be relevant to the  \ndetermination of a device’s biocompatibility.  As a general matter, the more standards included in the \nprogram, the more inclined developers will be to use the program. Currently, a developer may  wish to use \nan ASCA laboratory for testing to standards within the program, but that laboratory may not offer the  \nrest of the testing needed. Increased number of standards in the program will facilitate use  of the  program \nas it is much easier to use one laboratory for all desired testing, i.e., one -stop shopping, instead of having \nto employ multiple laboratories.  \n \nWe continue to encourage FDA to incorporate all relevant biocompatibility standards, and all methods \nwithin the standards, into the ASCA program. For instance, we reiterate our recommendation that FDA \ninclude ISO 18562-1: Biological Evaluation of Gas Pathw ays, the FDA -recognized gas pathways  Division of Dockets Management (HFA -305)      F DA-2019-D- 3805- 0073  \nDecember  19, 202 4 \nPage 5 of 18 \n \n \n \n \nbiocompatibility standard, into the ASCA Program. We appreciate FDA movement in this direction with \nthe addition of biocompatibility standards into the ASCA program. We look forward to FDA applying these standards and methods in a clinically relevant, benefit-risk manner.  Further, general and specific comments and constructive recommendations follow in the tables. They are \nintended to assist in clarity and use of the guidance. We believe our recommendations are consistent with the goals of the guidance and accompanying documents and help improve meaningful understanding and practical application of the guidance by industry and FDA, to the benefit of patients.  \nWe appreciate FDA’s work to develop the draft guidance and accompanying documents and stand ready \nto assist.

The word “opinion” is very subjective. \n11.  642 If solvent incompatibility can be well documented for \ngroup or class of material, surface finish and mechanical \nstress, this may be leveraged in lieu of repeated solvent \ncompatibility studies.  \n Paragraph starting at line 642 considers only a novel medical device material.  Our proposed language would address non- novel materials. \nExamples are common where there is known solvent incompatibility with a class of materials and a given solvent (for exa mple Liquid \nSilicone Rubbers (LSRs) and hexane). Continued expectations for solvent compatibility studies to provide that any given LSR is incompatible with Hexane do not add value to the chemical characterization process. A pathway is therefore recommended where this can be documented and justified as part of the chemical \ncharacterization process.

However, if the standard do es not \npermit the modifications used during testing, the modifications would be considered deviations , and the \ntesting would not be considered to have been conducted in compliance with the standard.  We understand modifications to be inclusive of abstention of \ncertain testing if there is adequate scientific rationale to not \nperform the testing in question.  For example:  \nSection 6.3.2.2 of ISO 10993- 1 indicates \n“Sensitization (e.g. delayed -type hypersensitivity) \ntests can be used to estimate the potential for contact \nsensitization by medical devices, materials and/or their \nextracts, using an appropriate model.

I provide this contribution drawing on the evidence from my current research in neurotechnology and emerging health technology. I am assistant Professor in Public Policy, and Policy Research Fellow at the School of Politics and Economics, King’s College London.  I have a background in biomedical science, neuroscience, medical ethics \u0026 law, and public policy.  I investigate neurotechnologies as cutting-edge medical devices and I focus on their social, ethical and legal implications.  More specifically, I address fundamental questions on the socio-technical issues around digital health technologies on the consumer market.  As part of my research, I conduct qualitative interviews with stakeholders across industries for inquiries on medical device design, development and application.  \nDr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 2 The FDA DHAC is at the forefront of the issue by providing this platform to discuss total product lifecycle and the impact of generative AI, on safety, efficacy and efficiency as medical devices enablers. I am delighted to provide my contribution toward a better understanding of generative AI-enabled medical devices for better patient care.  Background and Context  Currently medical devices are playing an ever-increasing role for an unparallel transformation in the healthcare ecosystem.  Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI as device enablers are powerful catalyzers in patient care and service delivery, that expand across every sector and industry. However, there are major concerns with their safety, efficacy and effectiveness, raising high concerns in patient care. In line with recent controversial debates, generative AI and similar AI tools currently lack appropriate guardrails, measurements, standards and metrics throughout the lifecycle in products and embedded parts.   Neurotechnology is an assembly of methods and instruments to enable the direct connection of tools to the human nervous system. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are AI-enabling technologies that are continuously used as medical apparatuses to transmit, monitor and regulate brain activities.1,2   Recent expansion of BCIs to electroencephalography (EEG)-based- computer interfaces (BCIs) have gained major popularity as wearable, non-invasive gadgets on the direct -to-consumer  (DTC) market.3, 4, 5  When paired with technologies such as AI or generative AI, EEG-based BCIs work as brain stimulators for real-time neurofeedback, biofeedback or as brain modulators.6  Whilst most BCIs are medical graded, and are subject to FDA regulation, EEG-based BICs do not fall under the same regulation.  Yet, EEG-based BCIs can serve the same function as clinical grade devices such as to assist, monitor health or capture critical health data for users.7, 8.  Over the past few years, the neurotech market has expanded significantly due to the low barrier to entry to market end ease of commercialisation of product. Yet regulation is lagging in this domain and appropriate policy does not yet exist.  Furthermore, competitive market opens doors for entrepreneurs and manufacturers to develop mobile BCI- (EEG) devices targeted at young adult without medical approval or necessity.9.  Originally, BCIs technology were designed to work  as amplifying tools to assist patient in rehabilitation and recovery.10, 11, 12    Dr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 3 Newest generation of BCIs such EEG-based BCIs emerged as new applications to paired with mobile Apps, and smartphones for sleep therapy, well-being, and gaming.  Their unregulated applications extend to the wider public for neurotherapy, pain management, mental illnesses relief e.g., anxiety, depression, personality disorders.  Manufacturers develop thousands of mental health Apps on the DTC sold as self-therapy to fill the similar purposes as traditional therapy.  However, it remains unclear whether brain interfering gadgets are likely to cause many unintended harms.    In recent years, patent applications have increased exponentially which include active patents and several thousands of pending patents’ classifications and applications.13  The questions of pre-market performance evaluation, risk and management and post-market monitoring are crucial in medical devices to address issues around product safety in lifecycle, interference, standards, and measurements.    While the development and expansion of generative AI-enabled medical devices gain momentum in the consumer domain, there is regulatory bodies have an urgent responsibility to address rising concerns such as biases, and challenges including interoperability, responsibility, safety, and equity in society.  Furthermore, as AI tools and generative AI-enabled medical devices to become pervasive in healthcare, they bring unprecedented challenges concerning ethics and distributive justice including accessibility, fairness and equity problems that potentially can widen the gaps of inequality in society.14    Relevant questions are pressing on the issues of responsibility, accountability, transparency, and data bias. For example, what are the measurements that are needed at the early stage of development, and in the lifecycle of the device to mitigate risk and bias?  Furthermore, medical devices whether invasive or non-invasive should be tested and evaluated for fit-for-purpose, in addition to ensuring safety, privacy, efficiency, accuracy.15  It’s therefore, critical that the FDA considers the total product lifecycle, and how risks around devices can be addressed starting in the design and development stages.16       Dr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 4 Critical Checkpoints in Assessing Lifecycle   To ensure quality standards and assurance, checks should be at the planning stage, development stage and implementation stage before commercialisation to identify, and mitigate risks across the total product lifecycle.  In addition, this testing evaluation is needed at several checkpoints throughout the lifecycle before commercialisation and market launch to identify risks and vulnerabilities, and where appropriate to address the identified technology readiness, and risks associated factors such as privacy, security, safety and societal risks.17    Furthermore, the DHAC should consider the associated risks in EEG-based BCIs as medical devices, and the rising societal, ethical and legal issue surrounding them. There is a need to compare the criteria in clinical-grade BCIs that are approved by the FDA against those in EEG-based BCIs devices that are not.  Furthermore, the FDA should consider the appropriate measures throughout the life cycle and development of all medical and non-medical devices that are paired with AI and generative AI systems.   In this sense, measurement throughout the life cycle will ensure calibration and data curation to ensure fairness, accuracy and equity in data outputs.  Furthermore, the socioeconomic and sociocultural elements can be catastrophic for vulnerable patients.18  AI systems are proven to be powerful clinical health tools that can be necessary medical interventions and treatments. However, erroneous AI systems can bypass an urgent treatment because of system bias from an underlying training data.  However, when AI tools are calibrated and benchmark at the right phase and stage, quality management and standards can ensure quality data outputs, compliance, including data assurance, data integrity in the collected data to detect against harmful biases.19.   However, recent report revealed generative AI can be biased or erroneous, even if machine learning algorithms are well trained.20  In addition, brain data output from neurotechnology opens the possibility to brain hacking for intruders to hijack those devices and possible control them.21 The associated risks intensified where vulnerable users such as children and the elderly and those who lack technology literacy.  Furthermore, the risk increased amongst vulnerable groups of people and those with medical and psychological conditions.  In addition, brain spyware can be used to infer user’s specific personal information such as identity, birth date, Dr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 5 bank information, residential address and location.22  Brain malware can infer with intimate information including users’ emotions, prejudices beliefs, political views; and use the data to manipulate users.23   As part of the product lifecycle evaluation, consideration should be given to data safeguards, and governance. Currently, there is no explicit guidance on security, data privacy or governance for generative AI-enabled medical devices. Existing regulations on medical data sharing tend to be too broad in scope.  Previous reports showed high risks of harm associated with data output for example sensitive information are subject to hacking and fraudulent activity through speech synthesis software or gaming such as privacy and security and data sharing.24, 25 Addressing the appropriate questions on data collection, storage and sharing are particularly important to ensure privacy and security risks are mitigated to reduce or avoid harms.26   Concerns on Policy and Regulation   The problems lie in the governance and policy that are scarcely available for the regulation of most medical devices. Overcoming the above challenges requires the right standards, benchmarks and metrics throughout the lifecycle of the devices.  For instance, there is no policy or regulatory framework to address the gaps in the law and regulation that protect neurodata outputs in neural interfaces. Furthermore, regulation and policy frameworks related to the sharing of personal data are not addressed at the early stage of development and implementation of generative AI.  It would be expected that EEG-based BCIs marketed as brain modulators and enhancers to be classified as medical devices on the consumer market.   Other factors may inhibit or prevent device developers to invest in a market that requires pre-market approval (PMA) path through the FDA.27  As a negative consequence, innovators may be deter or shy away from lengthy regulatory process that slows down creativity and innovation. Nevertheless, the rapid expansion expansions of portable, wearable neurotechnologies outline the necessity for their governance and policy implementation.  At the micro level, regulators tend to use performance measures as way of determining manufacturers to plan and record keeping ensuring scrutiny or close monitoring.  Methods of validating and calibration of new systems can ensure that formulation of intelligent AI systems and their behaviors are within the boundary for safety, security and ethical standards.28 Dr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 6   By nature, medical devices are heterogeneous and highly dynamics.  Popular questions that are often asked for neurotechnology include 1) whether there is a need to regulation for consumer device; 2) what sort of regulation is needed around the ‘nature’ of such product?  But very often governments intervention takes place in several stages in market.29  Regulation and governance framework can be efficient at the lifecycle of products, especially where the market is dynamics and highly diverse in nature. Regulations can be efficient when implementation is done in stages such as at planning, process production, outputs and delivery.  Moreover, different types of products can facilitate the design and typology of regulation based on design or specification standards and measurement.30  Currently, it exists differences in the level of regulations between clinically grade BCIs devices and the EEG-based BCIs. Drawing from the available quantitative, qualitative and observational studies conducted around these neurotechnology it can be concluded that medical devices are complex in nature.  However, generative AI as enablers and actualizer offers a mutually beneficial relationship in medical technology such as AI tools can harness the full potential of devices to deliver optimal treatment and care to patient.  At the same time, there is the urgency to address the associated risks including safety, effectiveness as well the social and ethical implications.    By ensuring appropriate regulatory standards are in place at the lifecycle of AI-enabled medical devices, the Committee highlights  the real value of the FDA and their function as regulatory bodies to ensure the highest standard and safety to benefit patient and the wider society. Lastly, I congratulate the FDA and the DHA Committee for their time and effort in providing this platform which offers the open invitation for contribution toward this cause.    This effort will help manufacturers and innovators to rethink about the human aspects (socio-technical factors) in their innovations and position themselves to deliver the greatest benefits to users.  Despite the limitations and shortfalls, generative AI as cutting-edge tools have the potentially to revolutionize patient care and cared delivery.  However, the long-term success of AI will depend on the approaches of the FDA as regulators for responsible development, implementation, practice and risk management of AI-enabled medical devices. Dr Moonga, J Public Comments DHAC Meeting – November 20-21, 2024 [ FDA–2024–N–3924]  \n 7  Conclusion  Generative AI and healthcare form a mutually beneficial relationship. As AI systems gain prominence and scale up to accelerate new therapies and treatment, the challenges remain around abstraction and complexity of AI tools. This in-depth evaluation of AI-enabled medical devices will enable deeper knowledge and understanding of medical devices, integration and implementation. There is no doubt DHA Committee will gather the necessary evidence to harness the potential of AI tools to ensure that AI-enabled medical devices are safe, and effective as they should for efficient delivery over the lifecycle of the devices.  We urge DHAC to take actions and shape its generative AI discussion into achieving the health and safety in devices. However, this goal cannot be achieved without an integrative table where all stakeholders can join force and collaborate to realize the objectives.  Thank you for  this opportunity to contribute and for considering the above comments.  I will be a pleasure to assist you further for any clarification.

The \nPCCP is reviewed as part of the premarket submission, negating the need for additional \nmarket submissions for future modifications.  The CAP applauds the FDA for providing in \nthe draft guidance a pathway that allows traditional test  developers /manufacturers  to \nmodify test systems to keep pace with the evolving needs of pathologists and clinical \nlaboratories . The CAP appreciates the example of updat ing breakpoints for Antimicrobial \nSusceptibility Test (AST) System Devices . The CAP has advocated for updates to these \nAST system devices because the lack of AST systems update s created a significant \npatient safety issue.  \n \nWhile t he CAP appreciates the FDA’s efforts to develop innovative approaches to \nregulation of traditional medical devices , we are concerned  about the timing of the draft \nguidance in combination with the FDA’s phas e out of enforcement discretion for \nlaboratory -developed tests (LDTs) . The draft guidance in combination with the final rule \non LDTs may result in a significant reduction  in the number of highly accurate LDTs \navailable in hospital and health system laboratories . The PCCP draft guidance requires  \n \nCollege of American Pathologists  \n1001 G Street, NW, Suite 425W  \nWashington, DC  20001  \n202-354-7100  developers to include specific modifications that are expected to be made  over time and \ncan be verified and validated  by the FDA. It should not be an extensive list of all \nmodifications rather a few. Moreover, the PCCP must align with the intended use , which \nwould not include specimen types or performance changes .  \n \nLaboratories modify existing FDA approved/cleared kits and/or LDTs to meet unmet \nneeds by adding new specimen types because of new indications or patient populations; \naddress the technical approach of an assay that does not perform adequately, consider \ncost because the laboratory possesses a testing platform/equipment or the availability of \nreagents. LDTs have been critical for the advancement of medicine and contributed to \nthe evolution of modern evidence -based health care services. LDTs continue to play a  \ncritical role in the advancement of medicine and clinical care for patients.  We are \nconcerned if this guidance is finalized in combination with the FDA LDT final rule, \nlaboratories will not be able to respond to requests from  physicians to provide LDTs.  \n \nSince medical practice undergoes continuous process change because of drug \ndevelopment and new treatments changing patient management strategies, the clinical \nlaboratory must adapt and change in parallel to support or extend clinical practice.  \nThe CAP recognizes that quality practices in the laboratory specified by Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) are distinct from operational requirements \ndefined by a medical device developer and  approved by the FDA . Our members have \nextensive expertise  in providing and directing laboratory services under the (CLIA) \nregulations, which require compliance with requirements (verification and validation of \nany new or modified tests or devices) through a quality system approach for overall \noperations and administration of the clinical laboratory. While PCCP may be an \ninnovative approach for traditional test developers /manufacturers , it would create \nadditional regulatory burden and uncertainty  for laboratory -based developers  as most  \nclinical laboratories freque ntly use and modify low -risk tests t o address  clinical needs for \ntheir local patient populations .  \n \n* * * * *  \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit these comments. The CAP looks forward to \nworking with the FDA and always stands willing to work with government agencies, \nindustry, pathologists, and other stakeholders to support high quality laboratory \noperations and medical care .

This petition requests that the Commission initiate a rulemaking regarding \"right to repair\". Our comments highlight our significant concerns with application of \"right to repair\" policies to medical devices regulated by the United States Food \u0026 Drug Administration (FDA).\nAdvaMed Medical Imaging Division represents the manufacturers of medical imaging equipment, including, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical X-Ray equipment, computed tomography (CT) scanners, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, radiopharmaceuticals, and imaging information systems. Our members have introduced innovative medical imaging technologies to the market, and they play an essential role in our nation's health care infrastructure and the care pathways of screening, staging, evaluating, managing, and effectively treating patients with cancer, heart disease, neurological degeneration, COVID-19, and numerous other medical conditions.\nThese comments complement and support those submitted by the broader AdvaMed association, highlighting specific concerns held by the medical imaging industry.\nHistorically, \"right to repair\" policy discussions have focused on consumer products such as household appliances, cellular telephones, and automobiles. More recently, advocates for \"right to repair\" policies have expanded their advocacy efforts to include medical devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A common basis for these efforts is unsupported claims that medical devices were not being appropriately maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic due to manufacturer-imposed restrictions. We have not seen any concrete evidence that medical imaging devices have gone unrepaired or un-serviced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the opposite is true: manufacturers went above and beyond to ensure that imaging devices were delivering patient care during those challenging times.\nAdvaMed Imaging is deeply concerned that application of \"right to repair\" policies to FDA regulated medical devices would have significant unintended consequences, presenting new and unnecessary risks to competition, patient and operator safety, device performance, and cybersecurity.\nAs is discussed in greater detail below, medical devices are heavily regulated throughout their lifecycle by the FDA, except in cases when a device is being repaired by a non-manufacturer servicing organization. Independent servicing organizations (ISOs) are not regulated or monitored by the FDA, nor are they required to have any quality, safety, or regulatory controls in place to ensure that they return the device to safe and effective condition for its intended use after servicing, maintenance, or repair activities. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), on the other hand, are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. OEMs are required to make themselves known to the FDA via registration, implement and maintain a quality management system to ensure consistent and controlled servicing processes, and file Medical Device Reports (MDRs) for device malfunctions that have caused or are likely to cause serious injury to patients and operators.\nKnowledge of and compliance with FDA regulatory requirements is essential to performance of medical device servicing activities in a way that results in the safe and effective operation of the medical device.\nAdvaMed\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n1 ::\nOperating within a quality management system as codified by FDA in 21 CFR 820: Quality System Regulation helps ensure that medical devices consistently meet applicable specifications and requirements. Currently, non-OEM medical device servicing operations are not required to implement quality management systems that conform with 21 CFR 820, and thus, are not subject to the same rigorous quality standards that help preserve patient safety and ensure devices are performing per their intended use.\nIn order to further their business interests, ISOs have made expansive demands for proprietary servicing materials such as service manuals, software keys, schematics, and tools. These same businesses have consistently refused even basic quality or safety controls requirements.\nDespite the claims made by these businesses, adequate performance of medical device servicing activities is not dependent only on possession of certain materials. In fact, uncontrolled use of proprietary, highly technical service materials by entities that are not required to have appropriate processes, training, and controls in place could lead to improper servicing of a medical device, dramatically increasing risks to patient safety, device performance, and cybersecurity. Safe and effective servicing is not merely acquisition of certain documentation or materials-it is the implementation of and adherence to a set of policies, practices, and procedures which consistently return the device to a state of safe and effective operation.\nWe want our devices to always perform safely and effectively for patient care. Application of \"right to repair policies\" to FDA regulated medical devices would, unfortunately, work counter to this objective.\n1. Medical device \"right to repair\" policies are a solution in search of a problem\nDemands for medical device \"right to repair\" policies are based on certain misunderstandings about how the medical device servicing market is currently functioning. Advocates for these policies claim that independent servicing organizations (ISOs) are suffering unfairly under the weight of OEMs and that there is inadequate information available to properly service medical devices. Both of these claims are false. The medical device servicing industry is robust and thriving and ISOs already have sufficient information that would enable them to properly service medical devices so long as they implemented and adhered to appropriate quality and safety standards and processes.\na. The medical device servicing industry is highly competitive\nMedical device owners and operators have numerous options available to them when selecting a medical device servicer. In a May 2018 report titled \"FDA Report on the Quality, Safety, and Effectiveness of Servicing of Medical Devices\" the FDA estimated that the total number of firms performing medical device servicing in the United States is between 16,520 and 20,830.1 By contrast, a recent study estimated\n1 https://www.fda.gov/media/113431/download\nAdvaMe\nde\ne of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n2 ::\nthat there are 6,500 medical device manufacturers in the U.S.2 Further, third party medical device servicing is dominated by big business with multiple largescale acquisitions occurring in recent years.3,4,5\nb. Medical device servicing is conducted under a number of freely chosen business models\nThere is no single valid business model by which medical devices are serviced. Service models and contractual terms are established at the point of sale, enabling health care facilities to decide what level of servicing they would like to purchase from the manufacturer versus take on themselves via in-house biomedical engineering teams or contract out to a third party.\nMany OEMs choose to service their own devices. Other medical device companies choose to partner with ISOs to extend their ability to keep their devices operating safely and effectively. Many OEMs establish a contractual relationship to make servicing materials and parts available. Each kind of relationship also differs in its specifics with varying kinds and degrees of support provided under a variety of contractual arrangements.\nMedical device manufacturers build their service capacity based upon installed base and adhere to rigorous service level agreements at all times. This includes use of overtime, travel out of regions, supplementing with highly trained contractors, etc ...\nGiven this, purchasers of medical devices and associated servicing activities have a sufficient amount of information to make informed buying decisions regarding the preferred devices and servicing options that are available.\nc. Medical device servicing organizations have a wealth of resources already available to support their work\nOrganizations engaged in medical device servicing or remanufacturing activities have a wealth of resources already available to them. Proper application of these resources will enable an entity engaged in these activities to determine their regulatory responsibilities as well as a path for returning the device to safe and effective condition for its intended use.\nCommonly available resources and their corresponding use include:\nAdherence to Regulation and Guidance\nMedical devices are heavily regulated through their lifecycle-both premarket and postmarket -- by the FDA.

It is the responsibility of the healthcare facility to maintain these documents.\n· Assemble, Install, Adjust, Test (AIAT) Information for X-Ray equipment as required under statute to ensure a device meets Federal performance standards (21 Code of Federal Regulations sec. 1020.30(g)).\n2. Implementation of medical device \"right to repair\" policies would create new and unnecessary risks to competition and patient safety\n\"Right to repair\" policies would require medical device manufacturers to provide to their competitors certain materials that would otherwise be considered proprietary or provided only under contract. Required disclosure of these materials would create competitive issues between the FDA regulated segment of the industry and the segment of the industry that escapes all oversight. Medical device \"right to repair\" policies would also create significant new risks to patient safety.\na. Forcing regulated manufacturers to provide proprietary information to non- regulated competitors will exacerbate competitive issues in the marketplace and erode trade secret protections\nUnregulated independent medical device servicing businesses have repeatedly made inappropriate, expansive demands for manufacturer proprietary information. These demands have gone well beyond what would be necessary to repair a medical device to include OEM proprietary information and trade secrets. Unregulated servicing businesses have attempted to use legislation and regulation to compel regulated medical device manufacturers to release proprietary service manuals, device schematics, wiring diagrams, mechanical layouts, tools, cybersecurity-sensitive servicing keys, and other materials typically held confidential or released only under contract.\nWe are deeply concerned that wide release of proprietary servicing materials will create an irrevocable loss of trade secret protection for manufacturers. If implemented, medical device \"right to repair\" policies would allow for uncontrolled replication and distribution of OEM proprietary information, potentially into the hands of malicious actors. We have already seen a willingness of unscrupulous actors to distribute OEM proprietary information via such uncontrolled channels as the iFixIt website. Not only do manufacturers invest significant resources into the manufacture and design of medical devices, they also invest heavily in innovation and development of servicing tools, training, and protocols. These specific proprietary resources are not necessary for the successful servicing of devices. For example, OEMs invest in these materials and use them in order to demonstrate traceability (i.e. that a device was properly manufactured, and subsequent repairs were completed according to specifications in the case of an adverse event).\nAs voluntary entrants into the market, independent servicing businesses should be required to accept responsibility for ensuring the return of medical devices to safe and effective operation and can do so by adopting appropriate quality systems-as specified by the FDA-and investing in the development of their own valid servicing protocols, tools, and training. Many non-OEM servicers also already make these\nAdvaMed\ncode\ne of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org ::\n@AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n5 ::\nkinds of investments in servicing tools, training, and protocols for the same reasons that OEMs do and are entities with whom medical device manufacturers regularly and willingly contract.\nRequiring regulated medical device manufacturers who have made significant investments in regulatory compliance and development of servicing processes to provide company confidential or proprietary information to unregulated competitors will have significant negative consequences for innovation and competition in this industry.\nImportantly, in many cases, one manufacturer may be contracted by a healthcare provider to service another manufacturer's device. Forcing one device manufacturer to turn over company confidential information or trade secrets such as design specifications or software access to a competing manufacturer when acting as a third-party servicer would be disastrous for competition and innovation.\nb. FDA exercises oversight over the medical device ecosystem, except non- manufacturer medical device servicers\nMedical devices designed, manufactured, and serviced by OEMs are categorically different than throughout their lifecycle to ensure safe and effective operation for an intended use, except with regard to servicing activities performed by an entity other than the OEM. The FDA has established strict pre- and post-market requirements for manufacturers of medical devices, including:\n· Establishment Registration \u0026 Medical Device Listing (21 CFR Part 807)\n· Premarket Notification (21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E) or Premarket Approval (21 CFR Part 814)\n· Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820)\n· Labeling (21 CFR Part 801)\n· Medical Device Reporting (21 CFR Part 803)\n. Reports of Corrections and Removals (21 CFR Part 806)\nAdherence to these regulations requires investment in people, processes, and technologies by medical device manufacturers.\nDespite the ongoing servicing and maintenance activity of medical devices, non-manufacturer entities- such as ISOs-have no FDA oversight and do not have to follow FDA regulations. Currently, only servicing activities performed by medical device manufacturers are held to quality, safety, or regulatory requirements by the FDA. This is important because performance of servicing activities within a quality management system by properly trained personnel using qualified, properly sourced parts reduces the risk of harm to the patient, healthcare provider, and device operator and reduces risk of poor performance of the device.\nWhether or not the manufacturer is also the entity which services a device, the OEM has a stake in all servicing activities for its devices. Improper servicing by unregulated entities presents significant concerns to the OEM, including creating challenges such as:\n. : Difficulties in providing future field upgrades or field corrections to the device if service history is unknown, improper parts have been used, or if the device has otherwise been altered;\nAdvaMed Code\nof Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n6 ::\n· Lack of required regulatory reporting and incomplete device history does not allow for tracking of significant events, root cause investigation, quality or safety improvement opportunities for the device, or prevention of adverse events;\n· Voided device electrical safety certifications (e.g. UL certifications);\n· Diminished brand value due to unsafe and ineffective operation of the device; and\n· Liability concerns for the manufacturer if the device injures directly or indirectly a patient or operator.\nc. Medical devices present unique patient and user safety risks that would be exacerbated by uncontrolled distribution of servicing materials\nImproper repair or servicing of a medical imaging device can present a wide range of risks for both the patient and others who interact with the device, including the servicer. These risks would be exacerbated by improper distribution of proprietary OEM materials to unregulated parties. If an unregulated party improperly repairs a device, the device cannot reasonably be relied on to safely and effectively meet its intended use.\nAlthough this is not a comprehensive list, there are a number of specific risks associated with improper servicing of medical imaging devices, depending on the imaging modality in question:\n· Electrical shock-If after a service event, the device has not been properly rewired or has unvalidated parts installed, the risk that an individual interacting with the device will receive an electrical shock is significantly increased.\n. Over exposure to ionizing radiation-Some imaging devices, including X-Ray and CT scanners, emit ionizing radiation. There is a risk of radiation over-exposure if these devices are not properly calibrated or maintained. While there are numerous built-in safeguards in this respect, improper servicing which bypasses these safeguards could lead to significant and irreversible harm.\n· Mechanical failure-If a device experiences mechanical failure due to improper servicing, significant and irreversible harm to the patient or user, ranging from painful pinching to serious crushing, could result.\n· Air embolism-In the case of injection devices (such as imaging contrast agent power injectors), if the device has undergone improper servicing, the patient could experience a potentially fatal air embolism.\n. Improper dosing-In the case of injection devices, if the device has undergone improper servicing, a patient could experience a potentially fatal under or overdose of medication\n. Infection-In the case of ultrasound probes and other patient contact devices, if the device has not been properly sterilized or disinfected as specified by the OEM requirements and instructions, transfer of infection or disease between patients could result.\n. Burns-Incorrect replacement materials or parts in an MRI system may disrupt the path of radiofrequency energy, causing excessive heating and potentially resulting in significant and irreversible patient burns.\n. Interference with other equipment-If a device's electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding has undergone improper servicing, operation of the device could potentially interfere or degrade the proper operation of other equipment in the surrounding area.\n· Cybersecurity-Whenever software is installed or adjusted for a medical device, or if software tools are used to access a device for diagnostic and maintenance purposes, the integrity of the\nAdvaMed\node\ne of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n7 ::\nsoftware may be compromised. Unvalidated software without confirmed authenticity or system integration may present significant potential security vulnerabilities and operational issues. Additionally, expanded and uncontrolled access to medical device operating systems and software applications creates the potential for increased cybersecurity risks, as the opportunity to intentionally or unintentionally introduce security vulnerabilities to the device and to any networks to which the device is connected (e.g. hospital) also expands.\n. Delay in patient care-Any failure in a device to perform when needed as a result of improper servicing, or to provide accurate results, may result in a delay of care, including incorrect diagnosis, resulting in delayed or incorrect treatment of a patient's condition.\n· Misdiagnosis-Improper servicing could cause a medical imaging device to perform in such a way that it does not produce diagnostic-quality images. This could mean that a patient is misdiagnosed.\nAdvaMed Imaging supports policies that promote the safety and efficacy of medical devices and promote competition in the marketplace. We are concerned that implementation of \"right to repair\" policies for medical devices would negatively impact competition and erode the safety and efficacy of FDA regulated products.\nIf you have any questions, please contact Peter Weems, Vice President, Imaging Government Relations \u0026 Policy Strategy, at\nAdvaMed Code\nof Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\n8 ::",

I am Assistant Professor in Public Policy, School of Politics and Economics, King’s College London.  As a neuroscientist, I follow the FDA guidance closely.  My research focuses on the regulation and policy of medical devices e.g., neurotechnologies. Therefore, the FDA’s guidance principle, policy, recommendation and implementation are essential tools for my research.    Firstly, I command the FDA for their continuous effort to improve regulation of medical devices.  It is evident that the primary focus of the FDA is patient safety.  I believe the FDA is doing a phenomenon job while setting an example worldwide.  However, I believe the FDA should place greater accountability on manufacturers and device developers throughout the stages of product development to ensure the right balance between risks and benefits.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being implemented in medical devices which will give rise to more risks including safety, data privacy and cybersecurity.  In addition, the FDA should insist on approval and clearance of medical devices made for emerging markets to protect vulnerable patients.    \nDr Moonga, J Public Comments PCCP Draft Guidance: eRulemaking Portal [ FDA-2024-D-2338]  \n 2 Furthermore, explicit guidance is essential on mechanisms for communication updates for medical devices criteria, evolutions, and updates. Because of the dynamic nature of AI/ML-enabled medical devices, the PCCP should integrate specific guidance on generative AI-enabled devices in controlling and monitoring for algorithmic data.  In addition, the PCCP should establish clear protocols on performance, risks of bias including algorithm bias in marginalised and underrepresented populations in alignment with CONSOR-AI.  The FDA should consider criticizing methods to response to ethical challenges and improve integrity.  Further PCCP guidance for developing strategies, ethical guidelines and implementations will be beneficial for generative AI-enabled devices.    I find the current PCCP Draft Guidance, FDA’s guiding principles appropriate and timely.  By nature, medical devices are heterogeneous and highly dynamics. In addition, risks are device-specific and fall into different categories based on the device and function.  Therefore, the standards set forth for clearing or approving a PCCP are grounded and embedded into the FDA values and purpose. However, there are questions that are not addressed by product developers or manufacturers such as those around accessibility in ethnics minorities and marginalized groups. Recent reports from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) indicate health inequalities remain a big problem. Also consider access in low-and-middle income countries.  The FDA placed significant weight on intended usage and PCCP, it is therefore imperative that the people who need healthcare the most have access to medical devices.  The FDA should consider, the inequality gap, health equity and global equity.  Lastly, critics highlighted the FDA regulator system as too rigid and burdensome for innovator which can lengthen the product approval process to negatively impact or slow product development, and timeline to market.  In reference to PCCP, requirements could inadvertently restrict the pathways that would require 501(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA should encourage manufacturers to obtain feedback prior to market submission. An iterative approach to the process of innovation could be beneficial.   Thank you for considering my comments.

In establishing the diversity action plan framework, Congress required FDA to issue or \nupdate guidance relating to \"the format and content of… diversity action plans… \npertaining to the sponsor’s goals for clinical study enrollment, disaggregated by age \ngroup, sex, and racial and ethnic demographic characteristics of clinically relevant \nstudy populations.”1 FDA’s draft guidance document, Diversity Action Plans To Improve \nEnrollment of Participants From Underrepresented Populations in Clinical Studies2, \nrequires sponsor to establish enrollment goals that include race, ethnicity, sex, age \ngroups to represent U.S. intended population, while it appears that CDRH expects that \nsponsor to “increase the diversity of study cohorts”, which raises a higher expectation \nthan what is stated in FDA guidance. \nWe recommend CDRH acknowledge that clinical data is not necessarily required for all \npremarket notifications to demonstrate substantial equivalence; or a clinical study \nwith a small number of patients to determine whether the new device is as safe and \neffective as a predicate device. We request CDRH clarify the expectation on “increasing \nthe diversity of study cohorts,” specifically in relation to individuals with different \nbackgrounds and lived experiences, as these descriptors are subjective and difficult to \nmeasure. \n1See Pub.

FDA’s draft guidance, Diversity Action Plans To Improve Enrollment of Participants \nFrom Underrepresented Populations in Clinical Studies, notes the \nincidence/prevalence of condition by demographic characteristics should inform \nenrollment goals. However, the considerations discussed by CDRH raises a higher bar \nof data analysis than that of DAP guidance. We recommend CDRH acknowledge the \npossible sparsity of data on the impact of demographic characteristics to the \ndisease/condition.  \nIn addition, the pivotal study is intended to assess the safety/effectiveness of the \nsubject device. A sponsor may not hold knowledge on the demographic impact to \ntechnology at the time of developing clinical study plan due to the paucity of data. We \nrecommend CDRH provide an alternative measure, that in situations where this data is \nnot available the sponsor could propose such an analysis in the study. For example, a \nsponsor may assess the primary endpoint(s) by race, ethnicity, age, gender etc., to \nelucidate the difference between various demographics. This may include assessing \npatient reported outcomes (PROs) by race, ethnicity, etc. \nPage 5 \nAlternatively, when this evaluation of relevant \ninformation does not identify any expected \ndifferences in outcomes between patient \npopulations, adequate information on benefits and \nrisks of a device is more likely to come from a study \ndesigned to collect data from a broad population \n(e.g., one that reflects general US census \npopulation). For certain medical devices, there may be situations where treatment outcomes do not \nvary across different patient populations and for which the intended use population is \ndifferent from the US census. Consideration should be given to elective drugs and \ndevices, as well as the population's interest in engaging with or using the product. In \ncertain cases, the patient group for a treatment or product is determined by the \npatient's desire to opt into the treatment, rather than the prevalence or incidence of \nthe disease or condition. A prime example of this is aesthetics products. We \nrecommend FDA incorporates this factor as a consideration for sponsors when defining \nenrollment goals and apply regulatory discretion. This will ensure that clinical studies \nappropriately represent the clinically relevant population for the specific product, \nconsidering the interest and engagement of the patient population.

It’s unclear if/how CDRH expects sponsors to address ‘potential gaps’ regarding clinical \noutcomes and device performance in clinically relevant populations. We recommend \nCDRH take a pragmatic approach and provide regulatory flexibility for sponsors in \naddressing potential gaps in available information regarding clinical outcomes and \ndevice performance in clinically relevant populations.  \nPage 6, Section III.b: Development of Clinical Study \nPlan  \nQuestion 1: Other than the three considerations \ndiscussed above (disease burden or condition; \npathology, anatomy, and pathophysiology; and \ntechnology), are there other factors that should be \npart of this evaluation of relevant information as \nsponsors identify a target population to address a \nclinical research question? There have been well established technologies/devices of which performance is well \nknown across the U.S. intended use populations, obviating the need for an in-depth \nanalysis. The type of device, risk of device, and device history should be taken into \nconsideration and taken potentially in lieu of analysis of disease burden and pathology, \nanatomy, and pathophysiology considerations.  \nPage 7 \nQuestion 3.b.: Are there examples of the types of \ndata sources that sponsors have considered for AbbVie engages in extensive efforts to develop and execute a comprehensive DAP. \nThese efforts encompass a range of activities to ensure that our clinical trial \npopulations accurately reflect the demographics of patients who will use our products. \nThis includes developing methodology in establishing a clinically relevant population, Docket No. FDA-2024-N-3616 \nPage 6 \nAbbVie               phone +1 301-822-9030 \nRegulatory Policy and Intelligence               fax       +1 301-822-9028 \n1700 Rockville Pike #500\nRockville, MD 20852Page/Section and Current Text Rationale or Comment \nobtaining relevant information related to the \nconsiderations identified above? What criteria have \nsponsors utilized when evaluating the suitability of \na data source? conducting thorough literature research to understand existing knowledge, identifying \npotential gaps, and leveraging best practices in diversity planning. We undertake an \nextensive review of historical data, to help us understand past trends, successes, and \nchallenges in achieving diverse enrollment, forming the basis for more informed and \nstrategic planning. Engaging healthcare providers is vital for aligning our goals with on-\nthe-ground realities and ensuring that our strategies are practical and effective. \nMarket research and discussions with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) allow sponsors to \ndevelop more informed and targeted strategies to enhance clinical trial diversity, \nultimately leading to more comprehensive and applicable study results.  \nPage 7 \nQuestion 4: Are there any challenges sponsors have \nfaced in obtaining, analyzing, reviewing, and \nutilizing relevant information from the areas of \nconsideration identified by FDA? How have \nsponsors approached situations in which \ninformation on expected differences in outcomes \nbetween populations is limited (e.g., for novel \ntechnology) or conflicting? For certain types of technology and disease, there may not be enough research or \nscientific data or clear prevalence and incidence data (e.g. aesthetic medicine). For \nnovel technologies, it is difficult to be able to draw meaningful conclusions due to low \nsample size. Depending on the device, it may not be possible to gather enough data \npremarket to identify different outcomes between population. Sponsors will face the \nsame impediments to recruiting diverse participants in the postmarket setting. \nPage 9 \nQuestion 1: Are there other areas that should be \nconsidered as part of FDA’s evaluation of safety and \neffectiveness, and how could this information be \nleveraged when FDA makes regulatory decisions? We recommend CDRH consider device risk, particularly for Class II and Class III devices. \nWell-understood device types may establish that there is little or no known risk of \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness with respect to demographic characteristics (e.g., \ndisaggregated by age group, sex, and racial and ethnic demographic characteristics of \nclinically relevant study populations). CDRH should provide sponsors the flexibility to \ndesign diversity action plans that are relevant to their specific device types and \nindications, with appropriate rationale.

We request clarification on the FDA's \nexpectations regarding the enrichment of study populations. \nReasonable Enrollment Goals: In scenarios where no available information suggests \ndifferences in patient populations, we request FDA provide recommendations and \nexamples for how sponsors should mitigate such an outcome. There may be studies \nwhere the enrollment of study participants in complete alignment with the U.S. \nprevalence or incidence of a given disease may be unrealistic; despite sponsor efforts, \nenrollment will continue to be affected by the limited number of patients that may not \nyield meaningful sub-group analyses. We recommend CDRH’s apply regulatory \ndiscretion and opportunities to revisit enrollment goals where necessary, to help \nensure goals reflect what is reasonable and achievable rather than impose additional \npostmarket study requirements solely to satisfy unmet diversity goals. \nTransparency in Labeling : We recommend CDRH clarify the expectations regarding \ntransparency about the study population in labeling, specifically for examples where \nno evidence suggests differences across the intended use population and clinical \nstudies. We would like to confirm that the FDA’s expectation is not to reflect the \nclinical study population as the ‘intended use population’ in the labeling. \n",

AdvaMed's member companies range from the largest 20 \nto the smallest medical product innovators and manufacturers . AdvaMed's member companies 21 \nproduce innovations that transform health care through earlier disease detection, less invasive 22 \nprocedures, and more effective treatments. AdvaMed advocates for a legal, regulatory and 23 \neconomic environment that advances global health care by assuring worldwide patient access to the 24 \nbenefits of medical technology.  The Association promotes policies that foster the highest ethical 25 \nstandards, rapid product approvals, appropriate reimbursement, and access to international markets.  26 \n 27 \nThe AdvaMed Medical Imaging Division represents the manufacturers of medical imaging 28 \nequipment, including, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical X -Ray equipment, computed 29 \ntomography (CT) scanners, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, radiopharmaceuticals, and imaging 30 \ninformation systems. Our members have introduced innovative medical imaging technologies for 31 \nuse by healthcare providers, and they play an essential role in health care infrastructure and the care 32 \npathways of screening, staging, evaluating, managing, and effectively treating patients with cancer, 33 \nheart disease, neurological degeneration, COVID -19, and numerous other medical conditions.  34 \n 35 \nWe respectfully request that AI -based medical devices already regulated by the FDA be exempt 36 \nfrom the proposed rule. The FDA’s current regulatory framework ensures  the safety and 37 \neffectiveness of AI/ML -driven medical devices. Requiring these devices to comply with additional 38 Page 2 of 3 \n \n reporting requirements would only create unnecessary redundancy and could delay patient access to 39 \ncritical medical innovations.  40 \n 41 \nThe FDA has established a robust regulatory framework for AI/ML -enabled medical devices, which 42 \nhas been in place for over 20 years. This framework includes both premarket review processes and 43 \npost-market surveillance requirements that ensure the safety and efficacy of AI -driven medical 44 \ndevices. Medical Device Manufacturers (MDMs) are subject to ongoing FDA oversight, including 45 \ncompliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) and adherence to post -market surveillance 46 \nmechanisms, adverse event reporting, and continuous product improvement based on real -world 47 \nevidence.  48 \n 49 \nIntroducing additional reporting requirements specifically for AI -based medical devices would 50 \ncreate duplicative regulatory burdens  which could lead to confusion and inefficiencies . The FDA’s 51 \ncurrent premarket submission and post -market surveillance requirements already provide the 52 \nnecessary transparency, safety, and accountability for AI -enabled devices. Creating new reporting 53 \nobligations would result in unnecessary delays for innovations reaching patients and overburden 54 \nproduct developers, particularly small businesses and startups, which could stifle innovation in 55 \ncritical healthcare technologies.  56 \n 57 \nFDA’s regulatory processes are tailored specifically to address the risks and benefits of AI -based 58 \nmedical devices. This regulatory oversight is not only rigorous but also flexible enough to adapt to 59 \nthe rapid advancements in AI technology. The FDA  regulatory framework  also allow s for a 60 \nPredetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP), which further enhances this flexibility by allowing 61 \nmanufacturers to make controlled updates to AI models without requiring a new premarket 62 \nsubmission. This ensures that AI devices continue to evolve safely without imposing undue delays 63 \non improvements.  64 \n 65 \nThe current FDA framework also addresses concerns related to discrimination and patient safety, 66 \nwhich the proposed rule aims to mitigate. MDMs are required to perform testing to ensure their AI 67 \ndevices are safe and effective for the intended population. These devices adhere to international 68 \nstandards, such as ISO 14971 and ISO 13485, which provide a foundation for risk management and 69 \nquality assurance. Existing FDA oversight mechanisms already mandate the evaluation of bias, 70 \nprivacy considerations, and the continuous monitoring of AI performance.  71 \n 72 \nThe FDA’s current regulatory framework ensures  the safety and eff ectiveness  of AI/ML -driven 73 \nmedical devices. Requiring these devices to comply with additional reporting requirements would 74 \nonly create unnecessary redundancy and could delay patient access to critical medical innovations. 75 \nWe urge the agency to exempt regulated AI -based medical devices from the proposed rule . 76 Page 3 of 3 \n \n Thank you for your consideration of our comments. We welcome the opportunity to work with the 77 \nagency to ensure that the regulatory environment continues to foster innovation while protecting 78 \npatient safety.  79 \n 80 \nSincerely , 81 \n 82 \nZack  Hornberger  83 \nSenior  Director,  Digital  Health  \u0026 Imaging  Technology  84 \nAdvaMed  Medical  Imaging  Division  85 \nE :: zhornberger@advamed.org  86 \nP :: 202-434-7263   87 \n 88 \nGeeta  Pamidimukkala,  MS 89 \nVice  President , Technology  \u0026 Regulatory  Affairs  90 \nAdvaMed   91 \n",

Box 8010  \nBaltimore,  MD 21244  \n \nRE: [CMS -1809 -P] Medicare  and Medicaid Programs: Hospital Outpatient Prospective \nPayment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems  \n \nDear Administrator Brooks -LaSure:  \n \nAVITA Medical (“AVITA”) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Centers for Medicare \u0026 \nMedicaid Services (CMS) request for comments on the Medicare hospital Outpatient \nProspective Payment System (OPPS) and the Medicare Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) \nproposed payment rule for calendar year (CY) 2025.  \n \nAVITA is a regenerative medicine company dedicated to transforming wound care and skin \nrestoration through innovative therapies. Our flagship technology, the RECELL® System, \nleverages the body’s natural healing processes to improve outcomes for patients wi th thermal \nburn wounds and full -thickness skin defects . We are committed to advancing patient care \nthrough continuous innovation, with a particular focus on enhancing health outcomes and \nensuring access to treatment for all patients, including Medicare ben eficiaries . AVITA strongly \nsupports CMS's commitment to maintaining an accurate payment system that ensures patient \naccess to innovative medical technologies.  \n \nIn this comment letter, we address key issues in the proposed rule that have significant \nimplications for patient access and reimbursement  for hospitals and ASCs  related to the  \nRECELL System . Our recommendations are as follows : \n \n• Incorporat e Transitional Pass -Through (TPT) Costs for the RECELL  System in the \nAPC assignment for  New CPT Code 15XX3: We urge CMS to use hospital -reported \nMedicare TPT cost  data for the RECELL  System and associated procedure  costs  to \ndetermine  the appropriate  APC assignment for CPT Code 15XX3  (Preparation of skin \ncell suspension autograft, requiring enzymatic processing, manual mechanical \ndisaggregation of skin cells, and filtration; first 25 sq cm or less of harvested skin ) \nfollowing TPT expiration on December 31, 2024.  \n  \nP 2 • Reassign CPT Code 15XX3  to New Technology APC 1575 : We strongly recommend \nthat CMS  reassign CPT code 15XX3 to New Technology APC 1575 - Level 38 ($10,001 -\n$15,000) to better reflect the hospital costs and resources required for this procedure.  \n \n• Finaliz e APC Assignments  for 15XX1, 15XX5, and 15XX7 : We support and \nrecommend that CMS finalize the p roposed APC assignments for CPT codes 15XX1, \n15XX5, and 15XX7 to APC 5054 . \n \n• Finalize ASC Payment Rates for 15XX1, 15XX5, and 15XX7 : We support and \nrecommend that CMS finalize the proposed ASC payment rates  for CPT codes 15XX1, \n15XX5, and 15XX7 .  \n \n• Reassign CPT Code 15XX 3 Payment Indicator from R2 to J8 and Adjust the  ASC \nPayment Rate : We strongly recommend that CMS reassign the payment indicator for \nCPT Code 15XX3 from R2 (office -based surgical procedure) to J8 (device -intensive \nprocedure; paid at adjusted rate) in the ASC Fee Schedule , as $7,220.34, or 71% of the \ntotal estimated procedure costs, is attributed to the RECELL device, based on the most \nrecent Medicare claims data.  \n \nBelow, we provide a detailed rationale for these recommendations . \n \nExpiration of TPT  Status for the RECELL  System on December 31, 2024  \n \nEffective January 1, 2022, CMS approved  TPT payment status for the RECELL  System  and \ncreated  HCPCS code C1832 (Autograft suspension, including cell processing and application, \nand all system components) . CMS intended the code descriptor to be comprehensive, such that \nall components of the device system are included in this code . With TPT status set to expire on \nDecember 31, 2024 , CMS should follow its policy of incorporating the device costs into the \nrelated procedure  cost. \n \nThe Medicare h ospital claims data from CY 2022 and CY 2023  show s the hospital -reported \ncosts for HCPCS Code  C1832 . These reported costs correspond to the first and second years  \nof TPT eligibility for  RECELL .  \n \nHCPCS  Descriptor  Single \nFrequency  Mean Cost  Claims Date Range  \nCY 2024 Final OPPS Rule Data  \nC1832  Autologous cell \nprocessing system  * $7,220.34  CY2022 OPPS Claims processed \nthrough 6/30/23  \nCY 2025 Proposed OPPS Rule Data  \nC1832  Autologous cell \nprocessing system  * $6,611.3 7 CY2023 OPPS Claims processed \nthrough 12/31/23  \n \nAVITA appreciates the application of TPT status to RECELL  over the past two years. We \nbelieve that the additional  TPT payments have been crucial in facilitating beneficiary access and \nensuring adequate hospital payment while cost data for this important technology was being \ncollected.   \nP 3  \nHowever, we are deeply concerned that the proposed APC assignment for CPT Code 15XX3 to \nAPC 5051 (Level 1 Skin Procedures) does not accurately reflect the hospital -reported costs \nassociated with the RECELL  System. Specifically, CMS’s proposed assignment does not \nadequately consider the hospital costs reported with C1832 during the TPT period, which is \ncritical as the device’s TPT status is set to expire on December 31, 2024.  \n \nInadequate hospital payment for the RECELL  device could significantly impact beneficiary \naccess to this important  treatment . Furthermore, failing to incorporate the device’s costs into the \nprocedure ’s APC payment undermines the core purpose of the TPT payment  methodology , \nwhich is designed to gather accurate cost data and ensure its integration into future APC \npayment rates . If these costs are not properly reflected, the TPT pathway will not have fulfilled \nits intended purpose.  \n \nInclusion of Reported Costs for the RECELL  System into Associated Skin Cell \nSuspension Autograft (SCSA) procedures  \n \nSince the TPT approval for RECELL  and the creation of HCPCS code C1832, the device has \nprimarily been billed with epidermal autograft  procedures, specifically CPT codes 151101 and \n151152. Additionally, CPT codes 151003 and 151204 for split -thickness autografts may be used \nbut must be accompanied by one of the primary epidermal autograft codes.5   \n \nIn September 2023, the CPT Editorial Panel approved the creation of eight new Category I CPT \ncodes to describe SCSA procedures , which will be effective January 1, 2025 .6 \n \nNew Category I CPT Codes E ffective January 1, 2025  \nCPT Code  Descriptor  \n15XX1  Harvest of skin for skin cell suspension autograft; first 25 sq cm or less  \n+15XX2  each additional 25 sq cm or part thereof (List separately in addition to code for primary \nprocedure)  \n15XX3  Preparation of skin cell suspension autograft, requiring enzymatic processing, manual \nmechanical disaggregation of skin cells, and filtration; first 25 sq cm or less of harvested skin  \n \n115510 (Epidermal autograft, trunk, arms, legs; first 100 sq cm or less, or 1% of body area of infants and children ) \n215115 (Epidermal autograft, face, scalp, eyelids, mouth, neck, ears, orbits, genitalia, hands, feet, and/or multiple digits; first 100 sq \ncm or less, or 1% of body area of infants and children)  \n315100  (Split -thickness autograft, trunk, arms, legs; first 100 sq cm or less, or 1% of body area of infants and children \n(except  15050) ) \n4151120 ( Split -thickness autograft, face, scalp, eyelids, mouth, neck, ears, orbits, genitalia, hands, feet, and/or multiple digits; first \n100 sq cm or less, or 1% of body area of infants and children (except  15050))  \n5Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services.

The harvested \nskin is then separated into sections measuring 2 x 3 cm, with the number of sections \ndetermined by the size of the treatment area.  \n \n• Prepar ing SCSA  (CPT 15XX3, 15XX4) (utilizing the RECELL  System ): \n \no Enzymatic Incubation: The physician places one or two sections of the \nharvested skin into the RECELL  System, where the skin undergoes enzymatic \nincubation for 15 -20 minutes each. After incubation, the physician mechanically \ndisaggregates a small portion of the skin to confirm that the enzyme has \nsufficiently broken down the cells. If the cells do not sep arate easily, the \nphysician returns the skin to the enzyme for an additional 10 minutes before \nreassessment.  \n \no Rinsing and Scraping: Once the cells are confirmed to separate easily, the \nphysician rinses the tissue with a buffer solution and places it dermal side down \non the mechanical scraping tray in the RECELL  System. The physician then \nvigorously scrapes the epidermal cells, altering the skin's orientation to ensure \ncomplete disaggregation.  \n  \no Collecti ng and Filt ering : The scraping tray  is rinsed with buffer to collect all fully \ndisaggregated skin cells. The SCSA is then carefully drawn into a syringe, \ndispensed, and filtered through a cell strainer  in the RECELL System . The \nfiltered SCSA  is drawn into a new syringe for application . \n  \nP 5 • Appl ying SCSA  (CPT 15XX5 -15XX8):  Following preparation, the physician applies the \nSCSA  to the prepared wound bed, completing the procedure. This step is reported using \nCPT codes 15XX5 through 15XX8.  \n \nImportantly, the primary function of the RECELL System (C1832 Autograft suspension, \nincluding cell processing, application, and all system components) is to prepare the skin cell \nsuspension. With TPT status for the RECELL System set to expire on December 3 1, 2024, the \ncosts associated with C1832 should be packaged into CPT Code 15XX3, which specifically \ncovers the preparation of the skin cell suspension using the RECELL System.  \n \nRecommendation:  AVITA recommends that CMS assign  CPT Code 15XX3 to an APC that \nreflects the packaged cost of the RECELL System.  \n \nAPC  Assignment for CPT code 15XX3  \n \nFor CY  2025, CMS has proposed assigning SCSA procedures described by CPT codes 15XX1 \n– 15XX8 to the APCs listed in the table below.  AVITA supports CMS’s proposed assignment of \nCPT codes 15XX1, 15XX5, and 15XX7 to APC 5054 (Level 4 Skin Procedures), as these codes \ndemonstrate clinical coherence and resource similarity to analogous procedures within APC \n5054.  \n \nCY 2025 OPPS Proposed Rule: APC Assignments for New SCSA Category I Procedures  \nHCPCS \nCode  Short Descriptor  CI SI APC  Relative \nWeight  Payment Rate  \n15XX1  Hrv skn cll ssp agrft 1st 25  NP T 5054  20.3885  $1,822.30  \n+15XX2  Hrv skn cll ssp agrft ea add  NP N    \n15XX3  Prepj skn cll ssp agrft 1st  NP T 5051  2.2276  $199.10  \n+15XX4  Prepj skn cll ssp agrft ea  NP N    \n15XX5  App skn cl ssp agrft t/a/l 1  NP T 5054  20.3885  $1,822.30  \n+15XX6  App skn cl ssp agrf t/a/l ea  NP N    \n15XX7  App skn cll ssp f/n/g/hf 1st  NP T 5054  20.3885  $1,822.30  \n+15XX8  App skn cll ssp f/n/g/hf ea  NP N    \n \n \nHowever, AVITA has significant concerns about CMS’s proposed assignment of CPT code \n15XX3 to APC 5051 (Level 1 Skin Procedures).  This assignment does not account for the \nhospital -reported costs for HCPCS code C1832 during the TPT period, which ranged from \n$6,611.37 to $7,220.34 for the RECELL  System . \n \n \n \n \n  \nP 6 Estimating the costs for CPT Code 15XX3  for APC Assignment  \n \nCPT 15XX3 specifically describes the preparation step in the procedure where the RECELL  \nSystem is utilized to cr eate the skin cell suspension . Incorporating the hospital -reported TPT \ncosts into  the procedure costs used for CPT 15XX3 APC assignment is essential .  \n \nTo estimate the costs associated with CPT 15XX3, we conducted a cost analysis using 2024 \nOPPS Final Rule claims dat a. This analysis determined the mean standard costs  for HCPCS \nC1832:  \n \n• Mean cost for C1832 : $7,220.34  \n \n• Additional case costs for medical and surgical supplies : $304.42  \n(This represents 33.333% of the total costs for medical and surgical supplies, which \namount to $913.25. The supplies are used throughout the harvest, preparation, and \napplication codes.)  \n \nWe also estimated the cost of Operating Room (OR) time associated with CPT code 15XX3 by \ncombining two key assumptions: (1) a per -hour OR cost estimate of $4,844.00 from a study by \nCarter et al.7, and (2) a 33 -minute intra -service time allocation from the recent RVS Update \nCommittee (RUC) survey. Based on these inputs, the OR time cost is calculated to be \n$2,664.20 (33 minutes * $4,844.00 per hour).  \n \nThe total estimated cost  associated with CPT 15XX3 , therefore, is calculated as follows:  \n \n• Mean cost for C1832: $7,220.34  \n \n• Additional case costs (medical and surgical supplies): $304.42  \n \n• OR time costs (33 minutes): $2,664.20  \n \n• Total  estimated cost : $10,188.96  \n \nThis combined total cost of $10,188.96 for CPT 15XX3 and C1832 exceeds the range of costs \nfor existing clinical APCs 5051 through 5055, which range in payment from $191 to $3,418. This \nindicates that none of the existing APCs adequately capture the true costs and resource needs \nfor CPT 15XX3. There are no analogous procedures within the APC Family of Skin Procedures \n(APC 5051 – 5055) that align with the cost or resource coherence of  CPT code 15XX3.   \n \nRecommendation : Based on the Medicare claims data and estimated resource cost of 15XX3 , \nAVITA respectfully requests  that CMS reassign CPT code 15XX3 to New Technology APC 1575 \n- Level 38 ($10,001 -$15,000). Additionally, AVITA recommends finalizing the proposed APC \nassignments for CPT codes 15XX1, 15XX5, and 15XX7 to APC 5054.  \n \n \n \n \n \n7Carter, Jeffrey E., et al. \"Evaluating real -world national and regional trends in definitive closure in US burn care: a survey of US \nburn centers.\"  Journal of Burn Care \u0026 Research  43.1 (2022): 141 -148.  \nP 7 ASC Payment Indicator and ASC Payment Rate for CPT code 15XX3  \n \nFor CY  2025, CMS has proposed assigning SCSA procedures described by CPT codes 15XX1 \n– 15XX8 to the A SC payment indicators and payment  rates  in the  table below.  AVITA supports \nCMS’s proposed payment indicators and payment rates  for CPT codes 15XX1, 15XX5, and \n15XX7 . \n \nCY 2025 OPPS Proposed Rule: Addendum AA – Assigned ASC Payment Indicators and Payment Rates  \nfor New SCSA Category I Procedures  \nHCPCS Code  Short Descriptor  Payment \nIndicator  Relative Weight  Payment  \nRate  \n15XX1  Hrv skn cll ssp agrft 1st 25  G2 17.7827  $972.27  \n+15XX2  Hrv skn cll ssp agrft ea add  N1   \n15XX3  Prepj skn cll ssp agrft 1st  R2 2.2276  $199.10  \n+15XX4  Prepj skn cll ssp agrft ea  N1   \n15XX5  App skn cl ssp agrft t/a/l 1  G2 17.7827  $972.27  \n+15XX6  App skn cl ssp agrf t/a/l ea  N1   \n15XX7  App skn cll ssp f/n/g/hf 1st  G2 17.7827  $972.27  \n+15XX8  App skn cll ssp f/n/g/hf ea  N1   \n \nHowever, AVITA is concerned with CMS’s proposed assignment of CPT code 15XX3 to \npayment indicator R2 (office -based surgical procedure). The preparation step described by CPT \ncode 15XX3 occurs between the harvest (CPT code 15XX1) and application (CPT codes \n15XX5 –15XX8) steps, all of which currently have a G2 payment indicator (non -office -based \nsurgical procedure). Since these st eps are intrinsically linked and must be performed together in \nthe same site of service, assigning CPT code 15XX3 to the R2 indicator is inappropriate and \nfails to account for the sequential nature of the SCSA procedure.  \n \nMore importantly , CMS’s proposed ASC payment rate for CPT code 15XX3 does not account \nfor the hospital -reported costs associated with HCPCS code C1832 during the TPT period  for \nthe RECELL System .  Based on  Medicare claims data, the device cost of $7,220.34 represents \n71% of the total estimated procedure cost of $10,188.96, far exceeding the 30% threshold for \ndevice -intensive procedures in the ASC setting . Therefore, we strongly recommend that CMS \nreassign CPT code 15XX3 to the J8 (device -intensive procedure; paid at adjusted rate) payment \nindicator to appropriately reflect its classification as a device -intensive procedure  and adjust the \nASC payment rate to incorporate the cost of the device.  \n \nRecommendation : Based on the Medicare claims data  and estimated resource cost for 15XX3 , \nAVITA respectfully requests that CMS reassign CPT code 15XX3 from payment indicator R2 \n(office -based surgical procedure)  to payment indicator J8 (device -intensive procedure; paid at \nadjusted rate) in the ASC Fee Schedule  and adjust the  corresponding ASC  payment rate to  \naccount for  the cost of the device .  \nP 8  \nConclusion  \n \nThank you again for the opportunity to comment on the CY  2025 OPPS/ASC proposed rule . \nWe appreciate CMS’s willingness to collaborate with all healthcare stakeholders, including  \nthe medical technology  industry , to improve access to care for Medicare beneficiaries .

                    "placeholder_summary": "gillette CHILDREN'S\nJune 12, 2024 Peter Buttigieg Secretary of Transportation Docket Management Facility U.S. Department of Transportation New Jersey Ave. S.E. West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140 Washington, D.C. 20590-001\nRe: Department of Transportation, DOT-OST-2022-0144, RIN No. 2105-AF14; Proposed Rule: Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers with Disabilities Using Wheelchairs\nDear Secretary Buttigieg:\nOn behalf of Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare (Gillette), we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Department of Transportation's rulemaking related to the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) that would address problems individuals with disabilities using wheelchairs and other assistive devices face when traveling by air.\nOur specialty hospital was founded more than 125 years ago to provide treatment for pediatric patients with disabilities, specifically children with significant musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. Our patients typically require intense lifelong care and medical intervention due to conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and epilepsy, as well as spinal cord and brain injury and skeletal deformities. The vast majority of our patients have multiple overlying and disabling conditions for which there is no cure. Many of them utilize assistive devices to help with mobility. Travel can be very challenging for our patients and their families.\nAt Gillette we offer assistive technology services for children, teens, and young adults who have disabilities and complex conditions that began during childhood. Our experts design custom orthoses, custom wheelchair seating, prostheses, mounts for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, protective headgear, power wheelchair controls and more. Working in teams, our providers develop custom solutions to improve abilities, health, and quality of life for children, teens, and young adults. We are experts at designing and making assistive technology and educating patients on its use. These devices, equipment, and technologies are critical to assuring our patients can enjoy improved independence and mobility.\nCommercial air travel is considered one of the safest forms of transportation. However, individuals living with disabilities face unique safety challenges when traveling by air, including mistreatment, and mishandling of equipment or devices. We appreciate the Department's intent to improve the air travel experience for individuals living with a disability.\nPlease see our answers below to the specific questions posed to which we have a response:\nQ: Is it reasonable to consider any mishandling of a wheelchair or other assistive device a per se violation of the ACAA? Why or why not?\nA: Yes - given the critical nature of these devices, the subjectivity of a negligence standard would cause unnecessary delay in adjudication which would cause further hardship to the disability community.\nMailing address: 200 University Ave. E., St. Paul, MN 55101 · 651-291-2848 · gillettechildrens.org\ngillette CHILDREN'S\nQ: Is the proposed definition for \"mishandled\" appropriate? Why or why not?\nA: Yes - if any of the scenarios mentioned in the definition were to occur, it would have significant impact to the individual with disabilities.\nQ: Is the Department's proposal that carriers must notify passengers of their rights and options when checked wheelchairs and scooters are mishandled sufficient? Why or why not?\nA: Notification should be completed as soon as possible, assuming that notification is done in a way that is known and understood (i.e. via telephone or other device) that will get notice to them quickly and that it is delivered in a language and in a manner that they can understand.\nQ: Should the proposal to notify passengers of their rights and options be limited to wheelchairs and scooters or extended to include other checked assistive devices?\nA: Consider expansion to other medical devices related to major life functions, including communication and mobility (i.e., computer-assisted communication devices, walkers, crutches, CPAP machines).\nQ: Are there any other concerns or factors that the Department should consider when a passenger's wheelchair or scooter does not fit in the cargo compartment? Because learning at the airport that a wheelchair or scooter does not fit in the cargo compartment can disrupt travel plans of passengers, should carriers be required to provide the dimensions of their cargo compartments prior to travel to any passenger who shares that he or she will be traveling with a personal wheelchair or scooter? The Department notes that airlines are already required to notify passengers, on request, of any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other assistive devices commonly used by passengers with a disability.\nA: Yes - consider voluntary or required identification of the device in advance at the time of booking a ticket to ensure cargo or cabin space. Regulations regarding prioritization of devices over other cargo should also be considered given the impact of travel disruption to the passenger with disabilities (flight change, delay in travel etc.). Consider requiring airlines to give prioritization of cabin space for devices that utilize lithium batteries and are thus only stored in the cabin.\nQ: In situations where the wheelchair of a passenger with disabilities is delayed or damaged and the passenger is waiting for his/her wheelchair for a loaner wheelchair at the airport, should airlines be required to provide safe and adequate seating options that will accommodate the passenger? What types of seat options would accommodate passengers with disabilities while they wait in the airport for their wheelchairs and what are the costs and logistics associated with having these options available at the airports?\nA: Yes - medical experts would need to be consulted as to options given the challenges of skin integrity for many individuals who are dependent on wheelchairs and other devices. A variety of options would likely be necessary. The types of seating options would vary based on the individual and the amount of time they would be without their device. Assuring timely delivery of the device or a loaner is important so as not to have passengers waiting for long periods of time, which will further impact their physical condition.\nQ: If an individual with a disability incurs additional, associated costs because a wheelchair or scooter is delayed, should the airline be responsible for reimbursing the individual for those costs? What are these\nMailing address: 200 University Ave. E., St. Paul, MN 55101 · 651-291-2848 · gillettechildrens.org\ngillette CHILDREN'S\npotential costs? What documentation should individuals provide to airlines to substantiate these costs? Should there be a limit to the airlines' liability?\nA: Yes - If the device is delayed overnight and the passenger has to reschedule the next leg of their flight or otherwise alter travel plans, additional lodging costs may be incurred. Food expense may be incurred if the passenger must remain in the airport. The loaner costs should be paid by the airline. Receipts for costs incurred and discussion with the airline personnel at the time should be required (this would allow the airline to take advantage of vendors where they may get preferred pricing with lodging or food etc.).\nQ: Are there sufficient vendors available to repair or replace passengers' personal wheelchairs or scooters? What is the average turnaround time once the vendor has the passenger's wheelchair in its possession?\nA: Not likely - many wheelchair systems are very complex, and few vendors have the ability to fix/adjust. Replacements could take months. In that instance a suitable loaner would be needed, and passengers should be permitted to send their chair or scooter to the vendor of their choice that they customarily work with to make necessary repairs or order a replacement if it is a custom seating system.\nQ: Should the Department consider stricter and detailed timelines rather than using a reasonableness standard to which airlines must adhere when handling wheelchair and scooter repairs and replacement?\nA: A strict timeline would likely be difficult given the challenges noted above related to availability of vendors. A reasonableness standard allows for variation. Another option would be to have a strict timeline for off the shelf devices, but something else for custom seating systems or custom scooters.\nQ: Should other types of airline employees and contractors be subject to the enhanced training requirements set forth in this proposal? For example, reservation agents gather information about consumers' travel needs and ticket counter agents handle consumer inquires, including disability related accommodation requests. Also, while managers may not directly assist individuals with disabilities or handle wheelchairs, they are often responsible for overseeing the airlines' processes and personnel. Is the existing requirement that individuals who deal with the traveling public be trained as appropriate to their duties sufficient?\nA: Yes - assuming that the other individuals involved in managing travel are held accountable to the policies enacted as part of these new rules. The Department could consider a tiered approach based on role. For example, employees responsible for transferring patients into a wheelchair may need enhanced training as opposed to ticket counter agents. One consideration would be to require initial training for those not directly handling the passenger or their devices and not require recurrent training for those individuals unless their role changes. All staff should be able to assist a passenger with a disability, even if it is simply directing them to the appropriate resource. One consideration would be requiring airports or air carriers to have a concierge desk for individuals with disabilities, or to incorporate this information into existing passenger assistance resources.\nQ: Are all repairs handled only by Durable Medical Equipment (DME) suppliers and should the Department address this issue in rulemaking? Would proprietary agreements or right-to-repair laws impact this or any of the current proposals set forth in this NPRM?\nA: This issue should be carefully considered as it is possible that repair by other vendors would void warranties or cause other legal challenges including contractual issues related to the passenger.\nMailing address: 200 University Ave. E., St. Paul, MN 55101 · 651-291-2848 · gillettechildrens.org\ngillette CHILDREN'S\nQ: What types of customizations should be required under this proposal, how much such customizations cost, and how quickly such customizations can be completed?\nA: The passenger should be entitled to have their device returned in the same condition it was in prior to releasing it into the custody of the airline. Whatever level of customization that requires should be mandated, whether this involves repair or replacement.\nQ: PVA also advocated for an additional option where, at the passenger's request, an airline would be required to provide a minor \"temporary wheelchair repair\" that is essentially sufficient to get the passenger out the door of the airport with their personal wheelchair so that they can continue on with their journey as planned to the maximum extent possible and seek out a \"full repair\" at a later time and date. Does this option seem reasonable to airlines and to passengers with disabilities? Would airlines logistically be able to do this? What exactly would a \"temporary wheelchair repair\" entail, and is this something that wheelchair repair vendors already offer/provide? If required, would airlines then need to have a vendor on-site at the airport to handle this? And if so, what types of costs would be associated with this option?\nA: Yes - this does seem reasonable assuming a temporary repair could be done safely.\nQ: If an individual with a disability incurs additional, associated costs because the loaner wheelchair provided by the airline restricts his or her mobility or independence, should the airline be responsible for reimbursing the individual for those costs? What are these potential costs? What documentation should individuals provide to airlines to substantiate these costs? Should there be a limit to the airlines' liability?\nA: This would likely need to be a \"reasonable\" standard as it's hard to determine what those might be. Documentation could include receipts or other substantiation of the cost incurred. There is no basis on which to limit this liability as they are entitled to have these devices returned in the same state they were in prior to turning custody over to the airlines. Loaner wheelchairs should also be required to meet the passenger's mobility needs to the greatest extent possible.\nQ: Are the proposed amendments to the training requirements in Part 382 sufficient to address concerns and inadequacies with current training practices?\nA: The training requirements should include both adults and children with disabilities as needs are different.\nQ: Should the Department require airlines to rebook individuals with disabilities on another flight on the same airline at no additional cost when their wheelchairs or scooters cannot be carried on their originally booked flights? Should this be limited to flights on the same airline, or should it be expanded to flights on other airlines or other modes of transportation (i.e., a train, bus, or rental car)? Should this only apply to instances when wheelchairs or scooters cannot fit on the passenger's flight or should it apply to other types of disability accommodations (e.g., the passenger's originally booked flight cannot accommodate the passenger's seating needs; or the passenger's originally booked flight does not have an accessible lavatory)?\nA: Yes - It should apply in any situation where the airline cannot reasonably accommodate the disability of the passenger. It should also include rebooking of at least one of the qualified caregivers traveling with the individual with the disability.\nMailing address: 200 University Ave. E., St. Paul, MN 55101 · 651-291-2848 · gillettechildrens.org\ngillette CHILDREN'S\nQ: Should the Department require airlines to refund the fare difference when passengers must book more expensive flights because their personal wheelchairs and scooters cannot be carried on cheaper flights? If so, in what situations should airlines be required provide refunds of the fare difference? Should airlines only provide a refund of the fare difference when the passenger's preferred flight itinerary that cannot accommodate the wheelchair and the more expensive flight itinerary that can accommodate the wheelchair have the same origin and destination, are on the same day, and have the same number of legs, stops, and connection points (if applicable)? Should airlines be required to provide a refund of the fare difference even if the preferred flight itinerary and the more expensive flight itinerary are not on the same day or do not have the same number of legs, stops, or connection points are different? Should a refund of a fare difference be required only if the preferred flight and the more expensive flight are offered by the same airline?\nA: Refunds should be required if there is not an option that will accommodate the passenger when originally booking. Refunds should also be required if the flight that initially would have been sufficient is changed by the airline and then no longer accommodates the passenger's needs.\nQ: Once a passenger completes the necessary steps and submits all the necessary documentation, should airlines be required to provide passengers a refund of the fare difference within seven days of receiving necessary documentation when ticket was purchased by credit card? Why or why not?\nA: A timeline should be established. We have no opinion on whether 7 days is the correct timeline, however consideration of interest payments on purchases should be taken into account.\nQ: What are the potential benefits of these proposals to passengers who use wheelchairs and scooters?\nA: The benefits to passengers who use wheelchairs and scooters include improved quality of life through equitable opportunities to travel by air. They can travel without the stress that their device will be an impediment to their plans. They can be confident that their needs will be met by the airline industry in the same way that others' needs are met when travelling by air, and that they will be treated with dignity and respect. Their burdens will not be exacerbated by new challenges that arise because of damage to their mobility devices. These proposals will allow individuals with disabilities to more easily participate in social and recreational activities that require travel. The impact will be felt not only by individuals with disabilities but will drive us toward a more inclusive and equitable society where there is greater understanding of the rights and needs of passengers with disabilities.\nIn addition to the above suggestions, please also consider that guidance should contemplate the needs of caregivers for minor patients and others traveling with adult individuals who need the support of a caregiver or personal care attendant. For example, rebooking of flights, seating availability on the plane etc. Airline or airport staff should still be required to ensure a smooth transition with mobility equipment even if a caregiver is traveling with an individual with disabilities.\nWe strongly support regulations that improve safe air travel for individuals living with a disability. We encourage the Department of Transportation to assure that any final regulations include sufficient enforcement mechanisms so that safety gains are realized.

Cook is a family-owned group of domestic and international corporations engaged in the manufacture of diagnostic and therapeutic products for use in various medical specialties including interventional radiology, cardiology, vascular surgery, critical care, gastroenterology, urology, reproductive health, wound care and surgery. We invent, manufacture, and deliver a unique portfolio of medical devices to healthcare systems of the world that includes more than 14,000 different product variations. Our company employs about 12,000 people around the world. Eight thousand of those employees are based in the United States and while more than 56 percent of our sales are used outside the United States, more than 70 percent of our products are manufactured in this country.\nWe thank the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the opportunity to provide comments on the draft guidance, Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment of Medical Devices, Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff dated September 14, 2024. The draft guidance has been issued \"to describe recommended methodological approaches for chemical analysis for biocompatibility assessment of medical devices.\"\nIt has been our experience that in the nearly five years since publication of the ISO 10993-18 standard that the views of CDRH staff on this topic have been communicated largely through deficiency questions raised during review of regulatory submissions (i.e., IDE, 510(k), De Novo, PMA filings). This process has been associated with significant delays and has resulted in delayed decisions for premarket submissions in many cases.\nCook strongly supports the need for this draft guidance as the process of Chemical Characterization is an important consideration of the medical device evaluation process.\nThe chemical characterization process for medical devices was outlined in the applicable international consensus standard ISO 10993-18 Chemical characterization of medical device materials within a risk management process and was developed more than five years ago as a means to reduce or eliminate the need for certain biological testing, including animal testing. The\nFDA Division of Dockets Management Docket No. FDA-2024-D-4165 December 18, 2024\npractical application of this standard allows evaluation of chemical characterization data with a toxicological risk assessment perspective meaning that toxicologists use these data to determine if detected substances may pose any potential biological risks based on exposure levels and known toxicity data. When it can be determined that risks are negligible, additional in vivo testing can be avoided.\nCook understands that a relevant international technical group, ISO/TC 194/ WG 14, is also developing guidance to address best practices for analytical chemistry in support of medical device safety evaluations. This project was begun in 2022 and we suggest that FDA make best efforts to align its expectations with the guidance being developed by this technical group, not the least because it reflects the current state of the art in the scientific community, but also because divergent expectations for this important testing restricts the ability of the device industry to bring forward new medical technology across the globe.\nOf note, key CDRH personnel have been, and continue to be, active in this related WG 14 work. In addition to specific comments provided in the Attachment to this letter, we also request that FDA consider the following:\n. FDA should fully recognize Example C2 in Clause E.4 of Annex E of ISO 10993-18 which provides a scientifically valid option for selection of the dose based threshold (DBT) in setting the analytical evaluation threshold (AET). By fully recognizing Example C2, the FDA could provide greater predictability for industry stakeholders about the criteria for selecting DBTs and would have an immediate positive impact on the design and execution of chemical characterization studies.\n· When evaluating a finished medical device for its biological risk, stakeholders (FDA and developers) should make every effort to consider all relevant data including information on the materials of construction and processing, biological safety testing, other preclinical in vivo testing, premarket clinical studies, post market clinical studies, years of commercial/clinical experience and the relevant patient population and duration of use recommended for the device in clinical use.\n· Because chemical characterization involves identifying and quantifying chemical substances that can leach or extract from a medical device under conditions of clinical use, we recommend the draft guidance be revised to recommend use of two solvents that bracket the clinical conditions of use -- one polar and one semi-polar, or in cases of clinical use in less polar environments (e.g., adipose tissue) one in the polar to semi-polar range and one in the semi-polar to non-polar range.\n. Further to the preceding point, binary alcohol water solvent mixtures have a long and extensive history of use for simulating leaching of polymer constituents into physiological settings; the bullet points listed at Lines 601 through 608 do not disqualify use of such solvents and we recommend these be removed from the guidance.\nPage 2 of 3\nFDA Division of Dockets Management Docket No. FDA-2024-D-4165 December 18, 2024\nConclusion\nChemical characterization provides a scientifically rigorous, efficient, and ethical pathway for evaluating medical devices. It mitigates the need for unnecessary biological testing, particularly in animals, while ensuring that patient safety remains paramount. This approach supports the industry's move toward more sustainable and humane testing practices.\nA guidance document with the Agency's current expectations for this testing is a step forward and such guidance, along with a practical and clinically relevant approach to its application, will permit the device industry to plan and execute device development more efficiently. This, ultimately, will improve timeliness and efficiency in bringing new medical device technologies to patients.\nWe also recommend the FDA consider the establishment of a data repository to catalog chemical constituents with no to low toxicological risk that could be used to as a reference to significantly streamline the medical device development process. By providing a reference database of pre- evaluated substances, developers could potentially reduce the need for extensive chemical analysis and toxicological testing. This would not only save time and resources but also facilitate regulatory compliance by offering a standardized resource for risk assessment. Moreover, such a repository could enhance innovation by allowing researchers to focus on critical areas of development, confident in the safety profiles of commonly used materials.\nThank you for issuing a draft guidance on this topic and for providing an opportunity to comment on this important public health matter.\nRespectfully,\nStephen L. Ferguson Chairman of the Board\nCc: Attachment Table\nPage 3 of 3\nCOOK MEDICAL COMMENTS on Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Staff - Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment of Medical Devices\nLine Number Starting\nSuggestion\nRationale\nGeneral\nCook thanks the FDA for the opportunity to comment on this important draft guidance. The clinical relevance, practicality and consistency of FDA expectations regarding chemical analysis for biocompatibility assessment of medical devices continue to be challenging issues, especially relative to ensuring timely patient access to life-saving and life-changing medical devices. Cook also notes that chemical analysis is just one part of biocompatibility assessment, and that biocompatibility assessment is just one part of the totality of information relevant to the benefit/risk assessment of medical devices, and we believe that emphasizing this context will remain important for the implementation of the guidance and FDA's review of submissions including chemical analysis for biocompatibility assessment. Further specific suggestions (shown with change tracking) and associated rationales follow in the table below.\n309\nExtraction conditions should be chosen to obtain worst- case estimates of amounts of analytes in the device to which the tissue may be exposed. You should provide a rationale for the extraction conditions selected that addresses the device exposure time and type of 306 tissue contact. The recommended extraction approaches are provided in Table 1, which was adapted from ISO 10993- 18 Table 2. The inclusion of this table does not indicate that chemical analysis is necessary for all devices. For example, chemical analysis is less likely to be warranted for devices with limited contact duration, devices with sufficient compositional information, and devices made via materials and processes with a history of safe clinical use. Conversely, chemical analysis is more likely to be warranted for devices with long-term contact duration, devices without sufficient compositional information, and devices made via novel materials and processes.\nFDA guidance is often misinterpreted as requirements, and even more so with a framework such as Table 1, which is likely to be misinterpreted as indicating that chemical analysis is necessary for all devices. Accordingly, the suggested additional text is supportive of a clinically relevant and practical approach to chemical analysis for biocompatibility assessment.\nTo encompass possible device-to-device variability, we recommend that at least three devices be extracted for each solvent, as either separate triplicate extractions or as\nThe recommendation for triplicate extractions in this guidance, combined with requirements in the current international standard for chemical characterization (ISO\n1\nLine Number Starting\nSuggestion\nRationale\n330\na single pooled extraction. To also encompass possible analytical variability, we recommend that either triplicate extracts be analyzed separately, or that a pooled extract be analyzed three times. Alternative approaches regarding possible device-to-device and analytical variability may be used with justification. For example, it may be acceptable to conduct a single replicate for particular device types if this is a historical practice or if a different number of replicates is recommended in device-specific FDA guidance(s) or FDA-recognized consensus standards. Triplicate extracts can be particularly important to: · Support a statistical comparison to demonstrate chemical equivalence (as part of material equivalency). · Evaluate devices that have a known higher potential for chemical device-to-device variability variability where small changes in chemistry at manufacture, over shelf life and/or where it is known that such variability while in use could impact safety and effectiveness. It can also be important for replicate or pooled extracts to include devices from multiple lots Evaluate devices where other information (e.g., engineering testing) identifies variability within/across product lots for devices that have a known higher potential for chemical lot-to-lot variability and/or where it is known that such variability could impact safety and effectiveness. When conducting separate triplicate extractions, we recommend reporting the identity of the extractables and amounts from all replicates separately. Additionally, we recommend using the highest amount for each extractable from any replicate as a worst-case exposure estimate (i.e., not a sum or average of the amounts from all replicates). chemistry testing that focus on the specific attributes affected by the modification.\n10993-18) create a situation that is overly burdensome and unnecessary to adequately encompass both possible device- to-device variability and analytical variability in chemical analysis, and the suggested edits offer a more reasonable and clinically relevant approach to encompass both types of possible variability. Specifically, ISO 10993-18 already states that \"The analytical process should be replicated by testing multiple aliquots of the extract, to account for analytical variation. Although triplicates are recommended, a smaller number of replicates can be more practical, if justified.\" ISO 10993-18 also already states that, \"Considering replication of extractions, a single extraction replicate for each vehicle shall be sufficient in those circumstances where it can be established that the variation in the test article's composition and/or the variation in the extraction process is low, establishing that the single extraction is properly representative of the test article and the extraction process.\" For illustrative purposes, with the recommended three solvents, triplicate extractions, analytical triplicates and approximately 5 analytical methods, a single chemical characterization study effectively becomes 3x3x3x5 = 135 studies, which is unwarranted in many cases. Additionally, the suggested edits offer clarity regarding when chemical analysis of multiple lots may be warranted.\n2\n-\nLine Number Starting\nSuggestion\nRationale\nSeparate triplicate extraction may not be necessary if three or more devices need to beare pooled for the extraction studies. For example, pooling may be warranted in some cases, such as for very small devices, to generate sufficient extract volume for subsequent chemical analyses. However, for devices that have a known higher potential for chemical device-to-device or lot-lot-lot variability, and/or where it is known that such variability could impact safety and effectiveness, if there is other data (e.g., engineering data) that suggests potential unexpected variability across devices, pooling devices instead of conducting triplicate extractions may not be appropriate.\n576\n· Additional information describing that the test article adequately represents the worst-case clinically relevant tissue exposure scenario: o Complete whole (not partial) device (or multiple complete devices) 0 Typically, the device with the largest surface area should be used because larger devices tend tomay contain greater quantities and/or numbers of extractables, and e. In most cases, it is not considered worst case to extracting smaller devices and extrapolating based on the direct proportion of extraction surface area may not adequately represent the worst-case clinically relevant exposure. 0 When applicable, the worst-case manufacturing process (e.g., the device that undergoes the greatest number of sterilization and/or reprocessing cycles) · Other information that could be helpful in a biocompatibility evaluation (e.g., the lot number/other identification number). For example, the time from manufacture and storage conditions could be helpful if chemical analysis is being used\nWithout the context of adequately representing clinically relevant exposure, the worst-case concept is subject to misinterpretation and misapplication, because more and more extreme cases can be envisioned. The example should be limited to avoid implying that chemical analysis is necessary support for shelf-life or expected to be repeated for aged device. Similarly, because root cause determination of all biological test failures is not possible, the example should avoid implying that this is expected.\n3\nLine Number Starting\nSuggestion\nRationale\ntoas primary support for shelf-life-studies or determination of root cause for biological test failure.\n715\n· Use of a balance with the capability to preciselywith adequate precision for measure-NVR assessmentsin the 10 100 µg range. As noted above, we recommend that the entire extract volume be dried for NVR analysis. However, if only a portion or an aliquot is used for NVR analysis, we recommend providing information on the aliquot volume and percentage of the whole extract, accompanied with a justification that indicates that the sensitivity of the approach in units of mass/device is appropriate. . Provide a tabular comparison of the total NVR amount to the total mass from other chemical analyses conducted for identification and quantification (e.g., GC-MS for semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), LC-MS for non-volatile organic compounds (NVOCs), ICP-MS for elemental constituents). Although 100% mass balance is not expected, the comparison should to-support that significant excessive loss of extractables has not occurred during processing and analysis.\nNVR assessment with 10-100 ug precision seems beyond the current generally available capability of chemical testing laboratories, and seems unnecessary for supporting that excessive loss of extractables has not occurred. It is also important to reiterate that 100% mass balance is not expected.\n1106\nConfident identification means that a single candidate structure can be assigned to an analyte. We recommend the following minimum information be provided te support a confident identification: that this be supported by library match or expert interpretation of mass spectral data; AND. Additional Supporting information (e.g., molecular formula/molecular weight, elemental composition, spectral data, RT) from one or more orthogonal methods (e.g., chromatography, spectroscopy)\nThe context should be noted that non-targeted chemical analysis is just one part of biocompatibility assessment, and biocompatibility assessment is just one part of the totality of information relevant to the benefit/risk assessment of medical devices. Such analysis employs arrays of analytical methods that together adequately encompass constituents that could be of toxicological concern, and each such constituent should be adequately detected and identified by one of the analytical methods. However, it is out of context and unnecesary to require that confident or confirmed identifications also include a second (or more) orthogonal methods.\n4\nLine Number Starting\nSuggestion\nRationale\ncan also be helpful with supporting confident identification. Confirmed identification means that the molecular structure has been verified using an authentic reference standard. We recommend that this be supported the following minimum information be provided to support a confirmed identification: by a library match or expert interpretation of mass spectral data; AND. Additional Supporting-information (e.g., molecular formula/molecular weight, elemental composition, spectral data, RT) from one or more orthogonal methods (e.g., chromatography, spectroscopy); can also be helpful with supporting confident identification. .

The modifications included in a PCCP must maintain the device within the device’s intended use, and as applicable, must allow the device to remain substantially equivalent to the predicate device. If a PCCP includes numerous modifications, or modifications that range across various aspects of the device, FDA may not be able to make a determination of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence for \nthe device and its PCCP.  A PCCP should not include a list of any/all \nmodifications that a manufacturer may possibly make. A PCCP should only \nconsider modifications that a \nmanufacturer may reasonably implement \nwithin the existing risk management \nframework of the device while still \nensuring the safety and effectiveness or \nsubstantial equivalence of the device.

Health care standards and quality of care requirements for in person services \nare also applicable to the remote provision of services through telehealth , and AAAHC accreditation programs \ninclude guidance for the application of our Standards when se rvices are provided through telehealth delivery \nmethods.  CMS -1807 -P \nSeptember 9, 2024  \nPage 2 of 7 \n \nAs CMS continues to extend payment for telehealth services, requirements for provider access to each patient’s \ncomplete medical record/health history and care follow up/patient satisfaction monitoring should continue to be \nenforced, as required within the AAAHC Standards. As long as telehealth service providers follow quality \nstandards,  AAAHC supports the continued ability for distant site practitioners to use the address of their currently \nenrolled practice location and the extension of direct supervision through  real-time audio and visual interactive \ntelecommunications . AAAHC respectfully request s the opportunity for comment prior to any decision for these \nallowances  to be made permanent . \nAAAHC believes that telehealth services are necessary for patients with resource limitations and behavioral health  \nconcerns , as well as medical conditions that affect access to care. Telehealth services increase access to care and \naccountability. AAAHC recommends that telehealth services  coverage be continued and  should include  \nidentification and application of quality standards necessary to ensure that any telehealth services reimbursed by \nMedicare are delivered in accordance with nationally recognized standards that demonstrate an organization’s \nongoing commitment to quality im provement and patient safety.  \nAAAHC further believes that, where nationally recognized quality standards are followed, providers lacking access \nto audio -visual communications can also provide quality care to patients . AAAHC recommends that CMS establish \nstandards for all providers offering telehealth services to ensure quality care is provided to all beneficiaries.  AAAHC \nbelieves that appropriateness of care should be documented in the clinical record and therefore documentation of \nthe rationale for furnishing audio -only services should  also be included. Where a provider does not have audio -\nvisual communication capabilities, the provider must still evaluate the appropriateness of audio -only \ncommunication. Similarly, where the patient requests or does not consent to visual communication, the provider \nmust still evaluate whether audio -only services are an appropriate method for care delivery for the individual and \nthe symptoms presented. In both instances, AAAHC would expect the provider to document the reason for, and \nappropriateness of, a udio-only care.  \nRequest for Information for Teaching Physician Services Furnished Under the Primary Care Exception  (89 \nFR 61636)  \nCMS propos es to temporarily continue allow ing teaching physicians to have a virtual presence for purposes of \nbilling services furnished involving residents in all teaching settings, but only when the service is furnished virtually \n(for example, a 3 -way telehealth visit, with the patient, resident, an d teaching physician in separate locations).  This \npermits teaching physicians to have a virtual presence during the key portion of the Medicare telehealth service for \nwhich payment is sought in any residency tra ining location . \nAAAHC encourages expansion of teaching opportunities through a virtual presence. Access to care and specialty \nproviders in some cases is dependent on the provision of telemedicine and given the nationwide shortage of \nphysicians, virtual supervision can hel p ease such shortages, enabling residents to provide additional services while \nharnessing the support of a teaching physician.  \nH. Supervision of Outpatient Therapy Services in Private Practices, Certification of Therapy Plans of Care \nWith a Physician or NPP Order, and KX Modifier Thresholds  (89 FR 61736)  \nAAAHC Standards require that all personnel assisting in the provision of health care services are appropriately \ncredentialed and privileged.  Supervision requirements are  incorporated into provider privileges,  predicated on state \nlaws, and vary based on practitioner type, scope of practice, and level of access. AAAHC suggests that as long as a \nprovider is practicing in compliance with state law requirements, that provider should be allowed to bill for the \nservices provided.  CMS -1807 -P \nSeptember 9, 2024  \nPage 3 of 7 \n \nAAAHC also supports removing the requirement for a physician signature on a treatment plan and delivery to the \nreferring physician within 30 days of initial evaluation . Removal of this requirement will not only decrease the  \nburden on outpatient therapy providers who currently must dedicate resources to physician follow -up efforts in \nattempts to obtain the necessary signatures but will also reduce unnecessary delays in p atient care and the initiation \nof therapy services for which the referral was issued.  \nI. Advancing Access to Behavioral Health Services  (89 FR 61740)  \n2. Digital Mental Health Treatment (DMHT) (89 FR 61742)  \nAAAHC does not support  the proposal to allow the furnishing of digital devices that have not been cleared by the \nFDA or another authority for mental health treatment specific use. The provision of digital devices without proven \nefficacy in treatment has the potential to reduce care quality , negatively impact patient outcomes, facilitate a false \nsense of security and  lower trust in providers.1  \nAAAHC’s Patient -Centered Medical Home programs promote the provision of whole -person care, includ ing both  \nphysical and behavioral health. In addition to the commitment of supporting Medical Home within CMS programs, \ntimely interventions and referrals are important in removing barriers to care and improving care coordination. \nAAAHC Standards require the direct  provision or coordination of crisis intervention and emergency services for \npatients presenting with high acuity, imminent danger, and/or high -risk behaviors. This includes adequate \nmonitoring with appropriate treatment planning and service provision and providing appropriate referral services to \nresources within the organization and/or community. Providers are to include the patient and caregiver(s) in the \nplan of care and referral options based on the patient’s presenting needs, functioning level, and ac uity of symptoms.  \n4. Comment Solicitation on Payment for Services Furnished in Additional Settings, including Freestanding \nSUD Treatment Facilities, Crisis Stabilization Units, Urgent Care Centers, and Certified Community \nBehavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)  (89 FR 61746)  \nAllowing Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) services to be furnished in settings other than freestanding Substance \nUse Disorder (SUD) facilities, such as community -based crisis stabilization centers, has the potential to improve \nthe access, efficacy, and c omprehensiveness of care services while reducing the need for patients to visit multiple \nservice locations. AAAHC supports this effort to improve care accessibility and availability, but requests \nconsider ation of  potential unintended impacts that may arise  when applying IOP service expectations onto facilities \nthat were not initially designed to serve this purpose. Adequate oversight and implementation guidance will be \ncritical to ensur e that effective, quality IOP services are being provided within these alternative facilities.  \nThese same concerns and considerations apply to any expectation that entities such as urgent care centers alter their \noperations and services to address emergency department (ED) capacity issues. ED overuse has been found to exist \nacross all demographics a nd payer groups, with overuse being attributed to limited access to timely primary care \nservices, limited access to after -hour and weekend care, the availability of immediate reassurance related to the \nmedical condition without the need for an appointment,  and primary care referrals to EDs for care services.2 Each \nof these causes point to shortcomings in the primary care system that need to be addressed and resolved. Therefore, \nalthough capacity issues can be transferred to alternative sites for care, such as urgent care facilities, the \nimplementation of such a proposal is likely a band aid instead of a solution.  \n \n1 John Hopkins Medicine.

Premier, Inc. analyzed that in 2017 there were 4.3 million potentially preventable ED \nvisits a t an associated $8.3 billion in costs .3 As CMS continues to build out payment incentives for quality care, it \nmay be effective to redirect the cost savings from any reduction in  unnecessary ED charges towards these potential \nsolutions . For example , this may include  offering increased payment rates and subsidies for providers and health \nplans who implement 24 -hour nurse line access, extended evening and weekend hours, and increased same -day \nservice availability. Additional support for retail and worksite clinics, telehealth, and patient education may also \nprove beneficial.   \nIII. Other Provisions of the Proposed Rule  (89 FR 61766)  \nA. Drugs and Biological Products Paid Under Medicare Part B (89 FR 61766)  \n4. Immunosuppressive therapy (§§ 410.30 and 414.1001)  (89 FR 61775)  \nAAAHC supports the Agency’s efforts to support and improve access and adherence by allowing compounded \nformulations for products with oral and enteral routes of administration (for example, oral suspensions or solutions) .  \nB. Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)  (89 FR 61780)  \nAAAHC supports simplified billing and documentation requirements, continued  virtual presence flexibility, \nexpanded coverage for telehealth services, parity for IOP services, modifications to payment for vaccine costs, \nremoval of RHC productivity standards, and the proposed revisions to the multiple visits policy for FQHC and RHC \nfacilities. Reduced burdens and costs coupled with increased access to care can only serve to improve the services \nprovided by these facilities as long as appropriate patient care s tandards and requirements continue to be met.  \nJ. Request for Information: Building upon the MIPS Value Pathways (MVPs) Framework to Improve \nAmbulatory Specialty Care  (89 FR 61984)  \nAAAHC appreciates the opportunity to provide input as CMS contemplates the implementation of an MVP model \ndesign ed to increase specialist  engagement  in value -based payment and encourage the engagement of specialty care \nprovider s with primary care providers and beneficiaries . AAAHC believes that t he strength of th e MVP model is \nthe specialty focus and the reduced set of measure s, creating  the potential to reduce administrative burden s. \nHowever, the MVP model  may also limit scoring potential , as it is depende nt on the number of quality measures \navailable , and CMS recognizes  that s ome specialties have fewer measures available for select ion. Subgroup scoring \nof administrative claim measures at the TIN level and exclusion of measures where  an affiliated group score is not \navailable  are additional challenges that currently exist within the MVP model . Therefore,  specialty -focused \npathways may result in increase d administrative burden for a multispecialty ASC as the proposal states that each  \nsubgroup must  report its own  MVP – as opposed to submitting as a singular  group.  \nThe administrative burden of measure collection should be meaningful and purposeful so that the information can \nbe used to improve quality of care and patient safety. The specialty focus of the MVP methodology offers more \nclinically relevant comparison  and enabl es ambulatory care facilitie s to benchmark with like peers. I ntegration of \nthe patient centered medical home (PCMH) concept s into the ASC and ambulatory setting s embodies the \noverarching goal of population  health , promot ing continuous quality improvement , continuity and coordination of \ncare, and partnerships to facilitate transitions of care .  \n \n3 Premier, Inc. (2019, February 7). Premier, Inc. identifies $8.3B savings opportunity in the Ed with more preventative and coordinated ambulatory care . \nhttps://premierinc.com/newsroom/press -releases/premier -inc-identifies -8-3b-savings -opportunity -in-the-ed-with-more -preventative -and-coordinated -\nambulatory -care  CMS -1807 -P \nSeptember 9, 2024  \nPage 5 of 7 \n \nThrough meaningful data collection, these settings  can improve clinical quality outcomes, promote effective  care \ndelivery, and provide efficient utilization of health care services . Accredited o rganizations maintain a \nmultidimensional,  multidisciplinary quality management and improvement program based on comprehensive data \nanalysis of clinical  needs, risk levels, and opportunities for interventions and improvements. Quality management \nand improvement within a AAAHC -accredited organization incorporates all stakeholders and intersects clinical and \nservice performance indicators with risk  management in an organized, systematic manner.  \nAAAHC ’s Advanced Orthopaedic Certification (AOC) is a data-driven, patient -centered program that  integrates \nthe seven pillars of the medical home model  and is well-suited as an alternative to PCMH within  the improvement \nactivities of MVPs  geared towards orthopaedic specialty care, such as Improving Care for Lower Extremity Joint \nRepair.  \nAAAHC supports the MVP framework and recognizes that the success of this model is dependent on specialty \nspecific measures which are still limited or in development. Based on the potential impact that mandatory MVP \nparticipation  may have on an ambulatory  care facility’ s overall performance, we urge CMS to delay the mandatory \nsubgroup reporting for multispecialty groups until adequate measures for each specialty  are made available . \nIV. Updates to the Quality Payment Program  (89 FR 62006)  \nA. CY 2025 Modifications to the Quality Payment Program  (89 FR 62006)  \n4. Potential Path Forward  (89 FR 62012)  \nAAAHC supports the Agency’s efforts in making MVPs available to all MIPS eligible clinicians  by addressing the \nexisting gaps in quality and cost measures . AAAHC continues to support the implementation of MVP subset \nmeasures and activities tied to a specific specialty, clinical condition, or episode of care based on the assumption \nthat the MVP measures would (i) reduce provider reporting burdens by minimizing the number of meas ures required \nto those most relevant to a provider’s services and (ii) focus on re levant measures related to patient safety and \nquality of care.  Where the majority of emerging new measures appear to be outcome -based, AAAHC encourages \nCMS to consider increasing the development of specialty -focused prescreening measures. Prescreening assessments \ncan serve as valuable predictors of outcomes and have the ability to reduce front  end, modifiable risks in advance \nof providing care services.4 These prescreening measures can be incorporated into risk adjustments and analyzed \nagainst outcomes , allowing CMS to expand measure availability within the MVP model while ensuring that the \ninformation obtained from the new measures is both meaningful and actionable . \nAAAHC supports streamlining the reporting requirements for all providers with practice specific measures, \nactivities, and interoperability while maintaining reporting flexibilities and alternatives for providers, ensuring that \nmultispecialty groups with a single TIN are not subject to a burdensome increase in reporting requirements.  \ne. Quality Performance Category Requests for Information  (89 FR 62042)  \nAAAHC believes that patient feedback is critical to quality care and the identification of areas for improvement, \nand AAAHC supports increasing the likelihood of response and patient feedback to CAHPS by expanding allowable \nsurvey modes to include web surv eys. \n \n4 British Journal of Anaesthesia. (2016, December). What is the rationale for preoperative medical evaluations? A closer look at surgical risk and common \nterminology . https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155558/  CMS -1807 -P \nSeptember 9, 2024  \nPage 6 of 7 \n \ng. Request for Information (RFI) Regarding Public Health Reporting and Data Exchange  (89 FR 62072)  \nAAAHC supports the promotion of  EHR adoption and believes it is important for CMS to incentivize adoption \nacross all programs, providers, clinicians, facilities, issuers, and services. Cohesive and comprehensive records \nenable a holistic view of patient health, ease care coordination and tracking between providers, expand collaboration \non patient outcomes, offer on demand and immediate access to patient charts, reduce paperwork, enhance \nworkflows, advance data analytics with notifications, track community h ealth trends, reduce errors caused by \nillegible notes or misplaced documents, and improve chart flagging of contraindications and interactions.  \nHowever, meaningful and lasting change will require assistance to the providers and patients who lack technology \naccess. Providers who lack access, or who serve populations that lack access, should not be penalized and should \nreceive incentives and financial support to improve their ability to purchase or license  these technologies. \nAdditionally, CMS and care providers  cannot operate on the assum ption  that patients have the ability to access an \nEHR, as doing so will ultimately result in increased inequity a nd disparities. AAAHC also points out that  a lack of \npatient access  to their EHR is largely outside of any provider’s control.  \nEven after full delivery of the “Internet for All Initiative ,” a substantial number of American s who are not \ntechnologically savvy  will remain . According to Pew Research Center5, 30% of U.S. adults need others to set up \ntheir devices , be show n how to use them , or are not confident in using online devices . In fact,  the majority of U.S. \nadults over age  65 express a lack of confidence  in using online electronic devices. This data demonstrates that  \ninequities against the elderly and the less educated could  be created by implementing measure s wholly  reliant upon \npatient EHR access . The need for consideration of these, and similar, statistics is only amplified by the fear created \nby increased numbers of data breaches and internet scams.  \nInformation security must be ensured. If patient health information is maintained in a single location, the potential \nfor unauthorized access is significantly increased. Even m edical devices that utilize software, such as pacemakers \nand insulin pumps, have the potential to be targeted in a cyberattack .6 CMS and the federal government as a whole \ncannot ignore that medical and hospital systems are increasingly targets of ransomware attacks,7 the majority of \nhealth care breaches originate with third -party vendors,8 the health care industry faces the highest breach -related \ncosts,9 and many Americans lack trust in the ability of health care institutions to protect their personal dat a. Steps \nmust be taken to address such issues prior to implementing additional EHR requirements for providers.  \nPatient education and awareness of the ir ability to access an EHR will play a key factor in promoting increased \npatient access, provided that the patient has the tools, knowledge, and ability to do so. AAAHC suggests it might \nbe effective to utilize  the CAHPS survey to query whether the patient has recently accessed their EHR and initiat e \nthe provision of educational tools and awareness resources automatically for patients responding “no”.  \nWhile AAAHC recognizes, supports, and values advances in technology, AAAHC is also acutely aware of the costs \nassociated with IT and digitization improvements . Therefore, we urge  CMS to continue evaluat ing the burden of \nincreased digitization on facilities  and remain cognizant of the fact that, although office -based providers now have \nan EHR implementation rate above 70%, only approximately 40% of AAAHC -accredited ASC facilities have EHR \nsystems in place . This results in the creation of an additional burden  on specialist providers that CMS must  account \nfor within the Promoting Interoperability performance measure s. \n \n5 Pew Research Center.

Increased costs may divert funds away from patient safety and \nquality activities such as accreditation and ongoing education. AAAHC believes that each organization’s governing \nbody is responsible for budgeting its resources to best serve i ts patients . While AAAHC Standards do not require \nelectronic records, they do incorporate consistency, confidentiality, and the inclusion of specific documentation \nsuch as allergies, appropriateness of care, and continuity of care within each facility’s chosen records system and \nstructure.  \nAAAHC applauds CMS for its vision on interoperability and the value this effort has the potential to  bring to patient \ncare and operational performance. However, t he cost s to implement and maintain such systems may be high and \nrequire additional  allocation of already scarce  resources , such as funding for hardware /software , IT support, and \ntraining. This raises the potential for a  limited success rate in implementation and further increases the cost and \nresource  burden . Where  CMS chooses to require digitization, AAAHC encourages CMS to provide sufficient \nsupport, resources, and time for providers to reach compl iance . \nb. Establishing the Performance Threshold Methodology for the 2027, 2028, and 2029 MIPS Payment Years  \n(89 FR 62089)  \nAAAHC supports the proposal to maintain stability and consistency throughout healthcare programs while efforts \nare made to identify and create a meaningful approach to the incentivization of performance improvement. Change \nfor the sake of change, without s upport from pilot programs and evidence -based research, is disruptive and \nburdensome. AAAHC approves  the Agency’s  decision to maintain the current 75 -point performance threshold.  \nh. Review and Correction of MIPS Final Score – Feedback and Information to Improve Performance  (89 FR \n62094)  \nAAAHC supports the proposal to allow score reweighting in instances where data for a MIPS eligible clinician are \ninaccessible or unable to be submitted due to circumstances outside of the control of the clinician because the MIPS \neligible clinician delegated submission of the data to their third party intermediary, evidenced by a written \nagreement between the MIPS eligible clinician and third party intermediary, and the third party intermediary did \nnot su bmit the data on behalf of the MIPS eligible clinician in accordance with applicable deadlines.  Providers \nshould not be penalized for occurrences that result at no fault of the provider. However, AAAHC Standards require \nthat the governing body approves and  ensures compliance with contracts or arrangements for activities or services \ndelegated to another entity,  recogniz ing that delegation of authority to vendors must be done responsibly, as the \nultimate responsibility for compliance and appropriate vendor management falls upon the contracting party.  \nFor any questions regarding this comment, please contact Ann Carrera, Senior Counsel , Legal \u0026 Corporate Affairs  \nat 847 -853-6060 or acarrera@aaahc.org.  \nSincerely,  \n  \nNoel M.

AdvaMed’s membership has reached over 500 \nmembers and more than 80 em ployees with a global presence including Europe, India, \nChina, Brazil, and Japan.  AdvaMed’s  member companies  range from the largest to the \nsmallest medical technology innovators and companies.  The Association acts as the \ncommon voice for companies producing medical devices, diagnostic products and digital \nhealth technologies.  \n \nAdvaMed has general comments as discussed below.    \n Division of Dockets Management    Docket No. F DA-2024-N- 3616 \nOctober  4, 2024 \nPage 2 of 3 \n \n \n  \nGENERAL COMMENTS  \n \nAdvaMed appreciates FDA’s request for feedback on factors and considerations described in \nthe Discussion Paper  “that may be important for sponsors and other relevant parties as they \ndevelop medical device clinical studies.”  We agree with FDA that there is an “urgent public health need for innovative technologies that help to reduce barriers to achieving health equity and that help to improve health outcomes across diverse populations.”  FDA plays an important role in  ensuring devices are safe and effective for use in the \npopulations for which they are intended, and we applaud FDA’s Center for Devices and \nRadiological Health (CDRH) for making “Advance Health Equity” one of the Center’s three priorities for FY2022-2025.  We believe FDA will be more successful in achieving  its goal of \nimprov ing health outcomes across diverse populations by partner ing with its sister agencies.  \nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), particularly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are also key players, and we encourage FDA  to \ncollaborate with these agencies to achieve this goal .  \n AdvaMed shares FDA’s commitment to health equity and has developed Health Equity Principles\n1 as an important resource and call to action.  At a high level, these principles reflect \nthat “the medical device industry, at its core, exists to ensure patient access to safe, effective, and innovative medical technologies that save and improve patient lives.  We are committed \nto ensuring that our mission is not compromised by the perpetuation of health inequities.”  We commend FDA for describing its preliminary thinking on factors and considerations important for sponsors and others when developing medical device clinical studies.  FDA’s request for feedback  on the factors and considerations discussed in the Discussion Paper , which may help \ninform the design of a clinical study that adeq uately reflects the intended use population for a \nparticular medical device , aligns with these principles and is most welcome.   \n We find the general concepts outlined in the Discussion Paper to be helpful and informative.  \nIn our view, health equity issues related to a specific medical device trial should be addressed within that particular trial, as such challenges are typically un ique to each device and study.  \nThese issues are not universally applicable to all clinical trials or devices.  Ensuring health equity often depends on factors related to the specific medical device and its therapeutic area.\n2 \n \n1 Available at  https://www.advamed.org/wp -content/uploads/2023/10/Principles -on-Health -Equity.pdf .  \n2 Please see AdvaMed’s comments on FDA’s  draft guidance entitled “Diversity Action Plans To Improve \nEnrollment of Participants From Underrepresented Populations in Clinical Studies; Draft Guidance,” issued in \nJune 2024 , available at https://advamed365.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/tara -\ngroup/EdzOYEXaN91ImuqI5pIkevIBE1sECQKLVWplPE9xW2r2 -w?e=r32a1I . \n Division of Dockets Management    Docket No. F DA-2024-N- 3616 \nOctober  4, 2024 \nPage 3 of 3 \n \n \n  \nAs FDA begins receiving and reviewing Diversity Action Plans, we would appreciate public \ndisclosure of any key best practices the Agency identifies, as well as ongoing updates on how to effectively incorporate the considerations and strategies outlined in the Discussion Paper to achieve health equity and improve outcomes across diverse populations.

Its members collectively account for a \nsignificant percentage of the sales generated through General Services Administration contracts, \nincluding the Multiple Award Schedule program. Members of the Coalition also are responsible \nfor many of the commercial item solutions purchased annually by the Federal Government. \nThese members include small, medium, and large business concerns. The Coalition is proud to \nhave collaborated with Government officials for 40 years in promoting the mutual  goal of \ncommon -sense acquisition. The Coalition has over 340 members, approximately  25% of which \nare small businesses. Many of our businesses have contracts with the U.S. Department of \nDefense (“DoD” or “the Department”) as well as Federal civilian agencies . \n \nThe Coalition fully endorses the security objectives of the CMMC Program, generally .  We \npreviously submitted comments to the 32 CFR Part 170 CMMC proposed rule, as was published \non Dec. 26, 2023, at 88 Fed. Reg. 89058.  Here, we submit comments to the 48 CFR CMMC \nproposed r ule, 8 9 Fed. Reg. 66327  (the “ 48 CFR Proposed Rule”) .  As discussed more fully 2 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  below, however, the Coalition recommends that certain provisions of the 48 CFR Proposed Rule \nbe revised and clarified.  \n \nImplementation  Recommendations :  \n1. Protect Prime Contractors Against Unknowable Risks of Supplier Compliance   \nThis comment concerns proposed DFARS 204.7503.  Prime contractors (“Primes ”) cannot access \nthe Supplier Performance Risk System (“SPRS”) and the 48 CFR P roposed Rule  provides no \nmeans by which Primes can validate the  security status , including CMMC compliance,  of the ir \nsubcontractors .  If the Government cannot make such information available to Primes (or other \nhigher tier contractors ), the regulations should explicitly state that the Government will allow \nPrimes  to rely on the representations and certifications of their subcontractors as it relates \nto CMMC  2.0 level status within SPRS.   Prime s should not be at risk of penalties for \nmisrepresentations or misstatements by subcontractors  regarding CMMC status or \ncertification .  This DFARS Part should explicitly state that Primes  will not be rendered ineligible \nfor award if the DoD concludes that a subcontractor  does not have a timely or sufficient \ncertifica tion status in SPRS .  Instead,  a Contracting Office r (“CO”) should alert the prime \ncontractor of the issue and allow such matters to  be dealt with after award  of the prime \ncontract.  Once a prime contractor is informed of a problem with one of its suppliers, it should \nnot make a subcontract award to that subcontractor until the prime contractor  is satisfied there \nhas been successful resolution or mitigation .  \n2. Improved Flow Down Instruction  \n \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule should be improved and clarified so that Defense Industrial Base \n(“DIB”) suppliers better understand what is expected of them in requirements to flow down \nCMMC obligations to their suppliers.  The 48 CFR Proposed Rule states:   \n \nDuring the phase -in period, when there is a requirement in the contract for \nCMMC, CMMC certification requirements must be flowed down to \nsubcontractors at all tiers, when the subcontractor will process, store, or transmit \nFederal contract information (FCI) or CUI, based on the sensitivity of the \nunclassified informati on flowed down to each of the subcontractors … \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 66328.  Many contractors need guidance on DoD’s expectations for flowing \nCMMC certification requirements to their suppliers .  The actual risk of information or 3 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  information system compromise, varies enormously among contractors and is highly dependent \nupon the context of the information shared and the scope of work assigned to individual \nsuppliers.  It simply is incorrect to presume that the security risks are equ ivalent for any \nsubcontractor that receives any form of information designated as Controlled Unclassified \nInformation (“ CUI”).  First, not all of the types of CUI established in the National Archives and \nRecords Administration (“ NARA ”) CUI Registry have th e same importance of potential impact to \nDoD, in the event of compromise, as to others.  Not all suppliers receive the same volume of \ninformation, or work on programs with the same implications for national security or receive or \nuse data exposed to equivalent third -party threats.  These conditions call for DoD to develop a \nmore nuanced approach to flow down, so that CMMC demands imposed upon the supply chain \nhave proportionality to the risks present at each supplier.   \n \nRelatedly, the 48 CFR Propose d Rule fails to provide much guidance on what means are \navailable to higher tier contractors to verify cyber compliance prior to awarding work to \nsubcontractors.  Prime s need better guidance on how to determine flow down requirements  \nand how to validate the security of their suppliers.  \n3. Confer Discretion to Decide When to Impose CMMC Requirements Within the 4 -Phase \nImplemen tation  \nThe now final 32 CFR Part 170 established a 4 -Phase Implementation Plan.   It’s unclear if a \nRequiring Activity (“RA”), or CO, has the discretion to make different decisions on which \nprograms or solicitations to place within the phases .  Does a RA or CO have the authority to \naccelerat e or delaying the timelines for programs or contracts under their authority?  We \nsuggest DoD confirm that the RA or CO, as applicable, can make decisions when, within the 4 -\nPhase timeline , they invoke CMMC contract requirements .  This may be necessitated by a \nvariety of external circumstances, such as whether a Certified Third -Party Assessor Organization \n(“C3PAO”) is available at the time, and the backlog or scheduling situation for assessments .  For \nreference , the now final  32 CFR Part 170 provided that Phase 2 would require Level 2 \nCertification by a C3PAO only after Phase 1 has been in place for one calendar year .   Given the \npresently small number of C3PAOs and the large volume of contractors  subject to Level 2 \nrequirements , the proposed 204.7503 should be revised to make it clear that RAs and COs \ncannot accelerate that timeline  and have the discretion to adjust the timing of when CMMC -\nspecific requirements must be satisfied .  COs should be authorized to con sider information from \ncontractors regarding their readiness.  Informal means should be permitted so that COs can \nreview readiness and regulatory timing with potentially affected suppliers.  \n 4 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  4. Authorize Contracting Officers to Decide Upon CMMC Level and Clarify How the \nLevels Will Be Set  \n \nThe 48 CFR  Proposed  Rule, at DFARS 252.204 -7021(b)(1)(i),  calls upon the CO to “fill in the \nrequired CMMC level.”  Proposed clause 242.204 -7YYYY  provides for notification to suppliers of \nthe required certification level.  The 48 CFR  final  rule should provide further clarity on the \nfactors to consider in setting the CMMC level  and accommodate contractor participation .  At \npresent, it is unclear how the “correct” level is to be determined. This leaves DIB partners in the \ndark on decisions that could affect greatly the time available, or even the feasibility, of meeting \nCMMC security requirements.  DoD also should consider changing the rule to enable COs to \nmake inquiries of contractors, and have consultations, before the CO set s the CMMC level .  \nBecause a CO may set a CMMC level that does not reflect the actual possession or use of \ninformation by a supplier, or the level or risk involved, it is advisable for the CO to be author ized \nto conduct fact -finding as needed before the CMMC level is set .  We therefore would \nrecommend that DoD clearly outline and publish the methodology for determining CMMC \nlevels , making further changes as outlined above .  Consultation with potentially affected \nsuppliers could improve the outcome.  \n \n5.  Include Flexibility in Administration to Avoid “Knock -on” Exclusion Effects  \n \nThe Department should recognize the risks to supply chain composition and continuity of supply \nthat may follow implementation of CMMC requirements to programs, solicitations, and \ncontracts.  The Coalition fully supports CMMC’s objective that DIB companies improve their \nability to protect the confidentiality of CUI.  There will be situations, however, where CMMC \nobligations will knock out critical suppliers in a program, weapon system, or sustainment supply \nchain.  Such “knock -on” effects could do harm to wa rfighters that are disproportionate to the \nbenefits received by eliminating less secure participants from the DIB.  This is why it is so \nimportant to build in flexibility in the administration of the CMMC contract clause requirements.  \nThe practical impact s of CMMC will depend upon the CMMC Level specified, whether a \ncertification assessment is required, and when within the 4 -Phase implementation program \nsolicitations incorporate the clause at DFARS 252.204 -7021.  It will greatly benefit the \nDepartment for it to authorize its RAs and COs to make risk -informed decisions on these \nvariables.  We think it important to provide for relief from CMMC demands in exceptional \ncircumstances, so that this regulation does not prove disadvantageous to the programs, \nsystems , and capabilities that it is intended to protect.  \n \n6. Clarify Treatment of Assessment Artifacts  5 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org   \nDFARS clause 252.204 -7021 should state that  the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity \nAssessment Center (“ DIBCAC ”) may assess or re -assess artifacts that are part of the High \nConfidence Assessments (Level 2 or Level 3) .  Re-assessed artifacts that require remediation will \nbe assigned a 6 -month Plans of Action and Milestones (“ POA \u0026M.”)  Where  DIBCAC  has \nperformed  a High  Assurance  assessment , it should  be accepted  without  re-adjudication  by \nother  DoD  components.  \n7. Provide Formal Waiver Procedures  \nThe 48 CFR Proposed R ule should create formal waiver procedures.  In the now final 32 CFR \nCMMC Rule, DoD advised:  \nOnce applicable to a solicitation, there is no process for OSA’s to seek \nwaivers of CMMC requirements from the DoD CIO.  In accordance with § \n170.5(d), a limited waiver authority is provided to the Acquisition Executive \nwith acquisition oversight for the program in question. These officials may \nissue supplemental  guidance dictating specific coordination requirements \nfor waiver requests. Recommended administrative changes have been \nincorporated into § 170.5(d) to add clarity . \n89 Fed. Reg. at 8 3114 .  This is not sufficient.  In Table 8 to the  now final  32 CFR CMMC Rule, DoD \nestimated there would be 76,598 entities requiring a Level 2 certification assessment, and 4,000 \nentities permitted a Level 2 self -assessment, over the phase -in period.  Another 1,487 \ncompanies are expected to satisfy Level 3 certifi cation.  8 9 Fed. Reg. at 8 3178 .  It will not \nhappen that Level 2 or Level 3 CMMC obligations will be achievable by the tens of thousands of \ncompanies without numerous instances whe re one or more of the SP 800 -171 controls cannot \nbe satisfied, where certain SP 800 -171A assessment objectives cannot be met, and where DoD \nwill be confronted with arguments that “compensating controls” are sufficient and that \n“enduring exceptions” should be accepted.  Because of the high bar set for POA\u0026Ms (excluding \nall “high point” items under the DoD Assessment Methodology and requiring an 80% minimum \nscore for all assessed items), it is a certainty that many valued contractors will experience \ncomplianc e glitches, shortfalls, or other problems, as would “fail” the CMMC assessment \nrequirements and exclude them from new or extended DoD supply contracts.  Such issues will \naffect contractors of all sizes, including many who are small businesses, and some who  are COTS \nand commercial suppliers, and the problem will be spread across all facets of DoD acquisition \nand supply.    6 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  Provisions should be added to th e 48 CFR Proposed Rule  to establish the process for waivers  \nand the considerations used by decision authorities.  The authority should include but not be \nlimited to individual contract actions, because some companies will present problems that cut \nacross all DoD contracts held by their enterprise.  Thus, the waiver authority should encompass \ncontractors, business segments, programs, as well as contracts and other cost objectives.  Levels \nof higher authorization should be arti culated depending upon the breadth, significance, or \nduration of the waiver.  Within the Military Departments, approval by the Head of Contracting \nActivity likely should be expected.  However, where waiver serves the national interest, the \nauthority of Ser vice Secretaries, and senior DoD officials (e.g., SecDef, DepSecDef, and \nUSD/A\u0026S) should be specified.   \nSome clarity on waivers can and should be specified in the final 48 CFR or 32 CFR CMMC Rules.  \nThe Coalition recognizes that full articulation of waiver authority, process, and guidelines could \nrequire a separate rulemaking beyond the pending 32 CFR and 48  CFR rules.  The Coalition \nstrongly urges that DoD’s CMMC leadership to include near -term waiver provisions and start on \nrulemaking for broader purposes.  In the prospective waiver rules, we urge DoD to incorporate \nrisk assessment and outcome comparison in to the waiver decisions.   \n \nNotification  Recommendations:     \n1. Reporting “Material Adverse Changes” Rather Than “Lapses” in Information Security  \nThe 48 CFR Proposed R ule, at 252.204 -7021 (b)(4) , would require contractors to notify the CO \nwithin 72 hours when there “are any lapses in information security or changes in the status of \nCMMC certificate or CMMC self -assessment levels during performance of the contract .”  The \nCoalition concludes that this requirement is unclear, and overbroad, as well as burdensome.  \nThe operative term, “any lapses,” is ambiguous, at best, and will be very difficult for anyone to \nimplement or administer.  Moreover, the “any  lapses” notification is an unnecessary addition to \nexisting reports required for a cyber incident .  While it  will produce continuing costs  to \ncontractors, and add to the workload of DoD personnel, we do not see proportionate security \nbenefits.  \nYet, the Coalition understands and agrees that DoD should be informed where the security of a \ncontractor changes in a way that affects the assurance that the Department has in doing \ncontinued business with that contractor.  We therefore recommend that this  clause be changed \nto require not a notification of “lapses” but where there is a “material adverse change” in \ninformation security or status of a CMMC certificate or self -assessment status.  While there is \nroom to debate what constitutes a “material adver se change,” this approach is familiar to 7 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  business enterprises and it sets a higher bar, for notification to DoD, than does the present \n“lapses” language.   \n2. Consider Government -wide Initiatives to “Harmonize and Streamline” Reporting    \nTo require notification over an undefined “lapse in information security” seems contrary to the \nDoD ’s and Congress’ stated desire to harmonize and streamline reporting and notification \nrequirements under myriad s of cybersecurity clauses being issued by various federal \nagencies .  Currently, DFARS 252.204 -7012 (c) includes a requirement to report to the DIBNET \nwithin 72 hours of a “cyber incident .”  We recommend that DoD rely upon this current DFARS \nprovision as the authoritative guidance for reporting of cyber incidents .  Several members of the \nCoalition urge that DoD go further and remove from the 48 CFR Proposed Rule the requirement \nfor contractors to report lapses in information security in this clause.   Their position is that the \nnew requirement adds unnecessary steps that should be handled using the existing DIBNET \nportal and SPRS systems.  They note that the SPRS system allows Contracting Officers to check \nand monitor for supplier compliance in a “one-stop -shop ,” suggesting little incremental benefit \nto additional reporting.  The Coalition is willing to support new reporting of “material adverse \nchanges,” as explained above, but believes that DoD should emphasize leverage of the systems \nit already has for visibility into contractor security over time . \n3.  Reconsider Notification to Contracting Officers  \n \nAs noted, the 48 CFR Proposed R ule, at 252.204 -7021 (b)(4), introduces a requirement to notify \nthe Contracting Officer within 72 hours when there are any “lapses ” in information security or \nchanges in the CMMC status. Apart from our other reservations, we question whether it is \nprudent to require such notifications to Contracting Officers.  Doing so invites potentially \nnumerous notifications, if a DIB supplier has multiple DoD contracts subject to CMMC.  Where \nmultiple COs receive such notices, the likelihoo d is high that there will be confusion, \nuncertainty, and inconsistency in such responses as individual COs make to these notifications.  \nThis serves the interest of no one.  The better way to handle notifications – of “material adverse \nchanges” as we urge – is for the notifications to go to the existing DIBNET Portal , using  SPRS \nsystems as employed today.   Once eMASS systems come to host CMMC assessment results, it \ncould be appropriate for the notice to go to that system as well.  Many officials with the \nDepartment, including Contracting Officers, have access to these DoD -enterprise systems.  This \nis a much better outcome than demanding a flurry of notices to individual COs when the \ndisposition or value of such notices is no better than conjectural.  Notific ation via the DIBNET 8 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  portal is more efficient, sufficient for DoD purposes, while consuming less time and resources of \nDIB companies.  \n \nThe 48 CFR P roposed Rule  requires contractor s to “ report  to the [CO] of any changes in the  list \nof DoD UIDs applicable to each of the  contractor information systems that process, store, or \ntransmit FCI or CUI during contract performance and to provide the corresponding DoD UIDs for \nthose contractor information systems.”   89 Fed. Reg. at 66329; see proposed DFAR 252.204 -\n7021 (c)(3).  This is an overbroad requirement because networks are constantly changed and \nmaintained .  They are not static, and, in fact, to sustain security over time, in an evolving threat \nenvironment, virtually requires adjustments and improvements – all of which, under  the \nproposed DFARS, would represent reportable “changes.”  As presently drafted, the requirement \nis against DoD’s interest as, arguably, it would motivate companies not to improve (and \ntherefore change) their information systems, in order to avoid reporti ng.  Accordingly, if this \nlanguage is retained, CGP recommends it be revised to require notification only when changes \nhave a material, adverse impact upon the contractor’s compliance with the specified CMMC \nlevel.  \n \nCOTS and Commercial Recommendations  \n1. Clarification of COTS Seller Definition  \nThe Coalition seeks clarification of the commercially available off -the-shelf (“COTS”) items \nexclusion in the 48 CFR P roposed Rule.  The preamble to the Rule states that it will not apply to \nCOTs which are defined at FAR 2.101.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 66238.  A COTS item, according to FAR \n2.101, is defined as an item that is “ sold in substantial quantities in the commercial \nmarketplace .”  A COTS product is one that has been sold, leased , or licensed to the general \npublic.   One Coalition member asks whether the COTS exclusion is limited to items that \nindividual companies have sold or offered to the commercial marketplace?  Or, they ask,  is the \nintent that the COTS exclusion applies to product s that are generally sold in the commercial \nmarketplace by anyone ?  We seek clarification.  We assume that the answer to the former \nquestion is that a COTS item is one that any seller, rather than an individual seller, offers to the \ncommercial marketplace in substantial quantities.   This company also inquires whether the \nCOTS exclusion applies to services directly related to a commercial product such as warranty, \ninstallation, or training?   The 48 CFR Propose d Rule should be clarified so that such ancillary \nservices are plainly subject to the COTS exclusion.      \n  \n2. Protection of COTS Sellers Against Misapplication of CMMC Requirements  9 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org   \nA member of the Coalition that is a furniture manufacturer  observes is considered selling COTS  \nitems .  CMMC  should not apply to  it. However, on certain large government business \nopportunities, this company has been asked to sign off on receipt of CUI and  to application of \nDFARS cyber requirements in order to gain access to floorplans  relevant to the supply of COTS \nfurniture .  This manufacturer has declined to participate in those solicitations  because it does \nnot intend to be certified for  CMMC  that should not apply .  We urge clarification of the 48 CFR \nProposed Rule to prevent Contracting Officers (or Prime Contractors) from unnecessary flow \ndown of  CMMC  requirements to COTS providers  such as this company.  Alternatively, a means \nshould be provided for COTS providers to demonstrate to Contracting Officers  (or Primes) that \nflow down is not appropriate.  As concerns COTS suppliers, DoD should understand that the \nCMMC rules, when applied unnecessarily, presents difficult administration and governance \nproblems for companies  with a national spread and multiple small offices and locations \n(office/factory/storage/shipping) . \nOther Recommended Clarification  \n1. DoD Unique Identifier  \nThe 48 CFR P roposed Rule adds a definition, at 204.7501, of “DoD unique identifier” (or “DoD \nUID”), which means “ an alpha -numeric string of ten characters assigned within the Supplier \nPerformance Risk System to each contractor assessment with the first two characters indicating \nthe confidence level of the assessment .”  Some members of the Coalition are uncertain of the \nrelationship between the DoD UID and CAGE Codes, and they also ask for clarification of how \nthe DoD UIDs will be used in the CMMC framework.   Particular clarification is requested with \nregard to how contractors may define “contractor information system” for purposes of \ngenerating a DoD UID(s) for systems that process, store, or transmit only FCI. Some large \ncommercial companies potentially have FCI in hundreds of systems depending on how “system” \nis defined and the exercise of inputting information and providing an a ffirmation  for each will be \na large undertaking. It is recommended that DoD allow for a company -wide assessment and \naffirmation fo r Level 1 and, if not, allow an extended implementation time from the date of the \nfinal rule. This is consistent with current CMMC 2.0 Level 1 scoping guidance, which provides, \n“[b]ecause FCI is a broad category of information, the contractor will likely focus the self -\nassessment on their entire environment.”  We think DoD should improve its explanation and \ntake care not to introduce, by use of DoD UIDs, another unnecessary layer of complexity with \nuncertain benefit.  \n \n2. Contractor Information Systems  10 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org   \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule, at 204.7503, and in the contract clauses at 252.204 -7021 and \n252.204 -7YYY , uses the term  “contractor information systems .”  The underlying DFARS clause \n252.204 -7012 refers to “covered contractor information systems” in seven (7) places but does \nnot use the term “contractor information systems” without the “covered” adjective.  Coalition \nmembers are uncertain of the significance  of the different phrasing, and raise concerns that \nusage of the different phrase in the 48 CFR Proposed R ule will broaden the scope of applicability \nto information system s which, because they are not “covered,” are  unrelated to CUI and FCI.  \n \n3. Security Changes   \n \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule references , 89 Fed. Reg. at 66329,  a requirement that contractors \ncomplete and maintain, on an annual basis, “or when security changes occur,” the affirmation of \ncontinuous compliance with security requirements.  This term is not used in the operative \ncontract clauses in the 48 CFR P roposed Rule and has no corresponding utilization in the now \nfinal 32 CFR Rule.  The term “security changes” is not self -defining, and the 48 CFR P roposed \nRule does not provide a sufficient, definition, metric, or framework to determine what \nconstitutes such a “security change ” as would necessitate reporting.  The Coalition believes that \n“security changes,” unless more clearly and narrowly defined, will create confusion and \npotentially cause unnecessary increased work that presents little to no value to DIB and DoD.  A \nbetter definition will limit obligations that flow from “security changes” to those that have \nimportance to and support DoD’s mission.   \n \nThe same objection and recommendation apply to the use of “changes” in the proposed DFARS \n252.204 -7021.  There, at 252.204 -7021 (c)(3), contractors are to report to the CO “any changes \nto the list of DoD UIDs applicable to each of the contractor information systems that process, \nstore, or transmit FCI or CUI and that are used in performance of the contract.”  Changes to \ninformation systems occur constantly and nothing in the fact or presence of a change \nnecessarily suggests or implies any adverse consequence to the security that DoD seeks.  \nPrevious ly, we’ve observed that DoD should leverage the existing reporting requirements of \nDFARS 252.204 -7012 (c).  If DoD feels compelled to add further notification obligations, the \nreporting should be limited to significant changes of that adversely affect DoD’ s mission.  \n \n4. Separate CMMC Security Levels ; Enclaves  \n  \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule has the following language at 252.204 -7021(b):  \n 11 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  (b) Requirements .  The Contractor shall – \n… \n(2) Maintain the CMMC level required by this contract for the duration of the \ncontract for all information systems, used in performance of the contract, that \nprocess, store, or transmit Federal contract information (FCI) or controlled \nunclassified information (CUI);  \n(3) Only process, store, or transmit data on information systems that have a \nCMMC certificate or CMMC self -assessment at the CMMC level required by the \ncontract, or higher;  \n \nThere are several significant problems with this language.  First, the language could be \ninterpreted to mean that where a contract requires a particular CMMC level for some \ninformation, e.g., Level 2 for CUI, the same level must be maintained for all infor mation systems \nof that contractor, even those that deal only with FCI but not CUI.  This is contrary to a central \nprincipal of CMMC, namely, that companies can establish enclaves within their information \nsystems so that FCI can be maintained at one, lesser  level of security, while CUI is maintained at \na higher level.  The proposition applies equally to situations where a DoD customer requires \nthat CUI be protected at CMMC Level 3.  It is important that this clause not be construed to \nmean that if some information is subject to Level 3, then all FCI and CUI on the same \ninformation system must be protected at that higher level.  Contractors are required to provide \nthe DoD UID(s) “ applicable to each of the contractor information systems that will process, \nstore , or transmit FCI or CUI and that will be used in performance of the contract .”  Proposed \nDFAR 204.7503(b)(2).  The 48 CFR Proposed Rule should be made clear that a location may \nprocess FCI or CUI at the different levels of secu rity required by CMMC Levels 1, 2 and 3 – and \nnot all at the highest level as may apply.  \n \n5. Senior Company Official  \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule states that an affirmation of continuous compliance, where required, \nis made by a “senior company official.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 66329, 66333, 66335.  The same term is \nnot used in the now final 32 CFR CMMC Rule, as it uses the term “ Affirming O fficial.”   Neither \nterm is adequately defined in either the final  32 CFR or 48  CFR Proposed Rule.  Coalition \nmembers observe that the “affirmation” by a company official is an act that has potential \ncompliance and legal consequences.  It is important to understand the level of official, or the \nnature of her or his duties, that DoD expects of a “senior” person making the affirmations.  Th is \nshould be made clear in the final Rule.  12 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  6. Definition of FCI  \nThe 48 CFR Proposed Rule relies on the definition of FCI from 48 CFR 4.1901 . An original \ndefinition of FCI, unique to CMMC, is requested. This definition should clarify certain terms \n(such as “not intended for public release” and “simple transactional information”) and provide \nthat FCI under DoD contracts subject to CMMC will be marked or otherwise identified. DoD \nshould also consider implications of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) on the FCI \ndefinition. Information that can be obtained through a FOIA request becomes public \ninformation. It would be helpful to have more cla rity on this point as information that may be \nmade public through a FOIA request does not appear to meet the definition of FCI. Adopting the \ncurrent definition of FCI may lead to confusion and a more broad application of CMMC than is \nnecessary.  \nObservations Regarding the Structure/Strategy of the CMMC Program  \n1. Affirmation Requirements  \nSome members of the Coalition question the value of the affirmation requirements .  CMMC \nintroduces a requirement that tens of thousands of companies, at Level 2 or 3, must pass \nindependent third -party assessments in order to receive compliance certifications upon which \ntheir eligibility for future DoD business depends.  This is the strength of the CMMC program.  \nAdding affirmation obligations, in the view of these companies, adds little value to the process , \nwhile creating addition al cost and work.   The affi rmation requirements also introduces further \nlegal and compliance uncertainty and add to the compliance burden with uncertain value \ngained.  \n2. Regulatory Harmonization  \n \nThe CMMC rules create a very detailed and complex set of requirements that apply just to DoD \ncontractors.  Many of these contractors also perform work for civilian agencies, and many are \nsubject to a variety of federal cybersecurity and incident reporting regimes.  Already, there is \nwidespread concern about the increasing costs of cyber compliance where so many different \nregulations apply.  Whe rever possible, the 48 CFR P roposed Rule should be updated to achieve \nbetter reciprocity across existing regimes.  Regulatory harmonization is needed not only within \nDRARS , but also across the federal technology ecosystem.  The 48 CFR P roposed Rule should \nexplicitly enable harmonization and formal ize available reciprocity with other IT security \nframeworks .  FedRAMP is an important example.  The cloud security requirements of FedRAMP , \nas apply under FISMA to federal agencies and departments, need not and should not apply 13 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  equally to any form of cloud or external cloud -based service as DIB contractors may use in their \nbusiness and to operate and secure their information systems.  Before transposing one security \nregime, like FedRAMP , to a different domain than that for which it was designed and intended, \nDoD should carefully determine what is necessary, cost -effective, and produces a sufficient \noutcome in light of informed risk management assessment.   \n3. Sufficiency  \n \nThe now final 32 CFR CMMC regulations and 48 CFR Proposed Rule are lengthy and complex.  \nThey are difficult for most companies to understand and even dedicated “experts” often \ndisagree as to meaning or application of the many rules and requirements.  Furthermore, \nCMMC will require tens of thousands of DIB suppliers to  satisfy demanding NIST -based cyber \nrequirements and to pass third party assessments as a condition to continued business with \nDoD.  For all the good intentions of the CMMC program, and with du e recognition of the threat \nconditions that call for increased information security, DoD must take an active role to manage \nCMMC implementation so that the program both succeeds to improve information security and \nretains full and vibrant participation, by  large and small contractors alike, and by legacy as well \nas innovative sources.  This balance will not be found if each of the many obligations of CMMC \nrules are interpreted and applied to require the “most possible” rather than what is “sufficient” \nfor a cceptance.   \n \nDoD must act to manage, oversee, administer, and guide CMMC implementation.  Too many \nbusinesses today, especially smaller businesses, have trouble making the “business case close” \nfor the costs of CMMC compliance versus their DoD sales revenues and return s on investment.  \nDoD cannot be cavalier to these widespread concerns. The Department can and should act \ndecisively to manage the regulatory burden and costs, so that CMMC is accomplished without \nexcessive costs of compliance and the risks of attrition in in the DIB industrial base and re sulting \nsupply chain disruption .  \nHealth Care Issues   \nThe Coalition includes among its members companies who build and sell COTS medical \ndevices.   One of these members raises a significant concern about the disparities in how the \nFood and Drug Administration ( “FDA”) qualifies the safety of such devices and mentions that \nDFARS requirements can be at odds with what the FDA requires.   Medical device companies \nneed greater clarity on how CMMC requirements will apply to them.   Considering the extent \nand intensity of FDA requirements for device authorization and con tinuing security, DoD should \nconsider whether it serves a positive or negative purpose to cause medical device makers to 14 \n \n1990 M Street NW, Ste 450  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  202.331.0975   |  thecgp.org  incur additional expense to comply with CMMC requirements.   Medical device suppliers are \nhighly regulated by agencies possessed of domain -specific expertise.   The FDA should be \nrespected as the authoritative source of medical device cybersecurity requireme nts.  DoD \nshould not interpose obligations, such as CMMC, that conflict or even interfere.    \n  \nCMMC compliance, if demanded of such device suppliers, imposes non -recurring investment \nrequirements and continuing costs that may produce no more than incidental or collateral \nsecurity benefits.   DoD in fact may injure its own interests if the CMMC demand s cause medical \ndevice makers to refrain from offering devices into the DoD market, as is a real possibility.   The \nDepartment’s best interest, here, could well be served by forbearance from application to \nCMMC to commercial medical devices that also can be  sold to DoD.   This area illustrates the \nvalue of having identified, funded, staffed, and authorized CMMC program management \nresources, within DoD, who can deal sensibly with sector, enterprise, or product -specific \nproblems.  \n  \nCONCLUSION  \nThe Coalition hopes you find these comments useful and thanks you for your time and \nconsideration. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact the undersigned at \nRWaldron@thecgp.org  or 202 -331-0975.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nRoger Waldron  \nPresident  \n \n\n",

Our members have introduced innovative medical imaging technologies for use by healthcare providers, and they play an essential role in our nation's health care infrastructure and the care pathways of screening, staging, evaluating, managing, and effectively treating patients with cancer, heart disease, neurological degeneration, COVID-19, and numerous other medical conditions.\nAdvaMed Digital Health Tech members represent the leading companies that are driving digital health innovation across healthcare, including AI-enabled health products and solutions, digital therapeutics, remote monitoring, connected care, wearables and provider care management.\nDocket ID OMB-2024-0004\nApril 29, 2024 Page 2 of 4\nWe applaud the administration's efforts to advance responsible AI innovation while protecting patients' rights and safety. We agree that bias and discrimination need to be proactively addressed in the development and deployment of AI-enabled medical devices and solutions. We encourage OMB to recognize the effective work done by medical device manufacturers and verified Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to achieve those aims in the medical device industry.\n4. How might metrics be developed and communicated to enable performance-based procurement of AI? What questions should agencies be asking vendors to determine whether AI is already being used in performance-based services contracts?\nWe believe the existing FDA review process, which evaluates devices for safety, efficacy, and fairness, should be seen as sufficient proof that an AI medical device meets the performance needs of agencies which look to procure medical devices. Additional AI procurement requirements would be duplicative. In addition, questions about a medical device's intended use, safety, and efficacy are highly specialized. It would be very difficult to replicate the expertise already provided by FDA and would not provide any additional safety or value to patients. Therefore, the only question an agency needs to ask medical device vendors is whether the AI-enabled medical device has FDA market authorization.\n5. What access to documentation, data, code, models, software, and other technical components might vendors provide to agencies to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in the AI M-memo? What contract language would best effectuate this access, and is this best envisioned as a standard clause, or requirements-specific elements in a statement of work?\nWhen an agency seeks to procure an AI-enabled medical device, they should defer to FDA oversight, which already requires medical device manufacturers to submit all necessary technical information to perform a thorough evaluation for safety and effectiveness, including performance.\nWe do not believe that any contractual language should mandate access to intellectual property and proprietary information such as data, code, models, software and other technical components, since compliance to requirements established by the AI M-memo are already achieved by FDA review and approval of AI-enabled medical devices and conformity to international voluntary consensus standards.\n6. Which elements of testing, evaluation, and impact assessments are best conducted by the vendor, and which responsibilities should remain with the agencies?\nMedical device manufacturers conduct rigorous testing, evaluation, and impact assessments, including generation of all necessary objective evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their AI-enabled medical devices. The FDA further reviews this data as part of the premarket\nDocket ID OMB-2024-0004\nApril 29, 2024 Page 3 of 4\nreview process to assess whether a given device meets the robust regulatory requirements for clearance or approval. Agencies looking to procure an AI-enabled medical device should accept the evaluation, and assessments conducted by FDA as part of their review process. No additional testing, evaluation, or assessments should be necessary or required for medical devices already reviewed by FDA.\n8. What if any terms, including terms governing information-sharing among agencies, vendors, and the public, should be included in contracts for AI systems or services to implement the AI M-memo's provisions regarding notice and appeal (sections 5(c)(v)(D) and (E))?\nTransparency is vital when it comes to the procurement and use of AI tools by government agencies like HHS and FDA. This is particularly important in the context of healthcare and drug regulation, where AI-assisted decisions can have far-reaching consequences for public health.\nInformation on AI procured and deployed by agencies should identify how the systems will be used in their operations and how it was evaluated for that use. If an AI system influences an administrative or regulatory decision that affects an individual or organization, they should be notified and provided with a clear explanation of the basis for that decision. There should also be a straightforward process for appealing the decision and having it reviewed by a human expert.\nContracts for AI systems or services should include these transparency and appeal provisions to ensure that the public retains trust in the use of these powerful technologies for the administrative and regulatory functions performed by agencies like HHS and FDA.\n9. How might agencies structure their procurements to reduce the risk that an AI system or service they acquire may produce harmful or illegal content, such as fraudulent or deceptive content, or content that includes child sex abuse material or non-consensual intimate imagery?\nOMB should be careful to avoid conflating the risks associated with generative AI (e.g., LLMs) with the risks posed by other AI technologies. The FDA has performed oversight for numerous AI technologies for many decades, which ensures that those devices that receive market authorization avoid the risks like those indicated by this question. Additional procurement language addressing risks associated with generative AI are not needed on top of existing FDA requirements for AI- enabled medical devices.\nDocket ID OMB-2024-0004\nApril 29, 2024 Page 4 of 4\nWe thank you for your attention to these comments and look forward to engaging further as the rulemaking process continues.

                    "placeholder_summary": " \n 1 September 9, 2024  Ms. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure  Administrator  Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services  7500 Security Boulevard  Baltimore, MD 21244-1850   Re: Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs; Proposed Rule   Section X.F Request for Comment on Payment Adjustments Under the IPPS and OPPS for Domestic Personal Protective Equipment   Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure,   The American Medical Manufacturers Association (AMMA) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed rule concerning the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, specifically regarding the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Payment Systems for Fiscal Year 2025. AMMA represents a broad coalition of domestic manufacturers of personal protective equipment (PPE) and critical medical supplies. We commend Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) thoughtfulness in crafting this proposal, which carefully considers the complexities and challenges of strengthening the domestic supply chain for these essential products.   1. Support for a National Standard for Cost Differential in NIOSH-Approved Surgical N95 Respirators   As the proposed rule outlines, CMS is considering modifying the payment adjustment methodology to provide a national standard unit cost differential between domestic and non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators rather than relying on a hospital-by-hospital approach. AMMA fully supports this modification. A national standard would simplify the process for hospitals, reduce administrative burdens, and encourage the broader adoption of respirators made domestically. We recommend that CMS implement this national standard to ensure consistency and fairness in the procurement process across the country.    \n 2 2. Simplification of Payment Adjustment Methodology   In line with the proposed shift toward a national standard unit cost differential, CMS also seeks feedback on whether the payment adjustment methodology should be simplified to encourage greater hospital participation (Section X.F). AMMA strongly agrees that the standardized approach outlined in the proposal would reduce administrative burdens and support the broader adoption of domestic products.   AMMA recommends setting the payment adjustment at a level that meaningfully incentivizes hospitals to purchase PPE produced domestically. Specifically, we propose a payment adjustment of at least five times the difference between the lowest average acquisition price of foreign-sourced items and the average domestic production cost. This multiplier would ensure that the reimbursement increase is significant enough to incentivize hospitals (especially larger hospital systems) while mitigating the additional markups from distributors through which these products are often purchased.   The 5x differential is crucial because: a. It provides a meaningful financial incentive for hospitals and health systems to choose domestic products, offsetting the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing. b. It accounts for potential markups in the supply chain, particularly from prime distributors, ensuring that the financial benefit reaches the end-users (hospitals) and not just intermediaries. c. It creates a buffer against market fluctuations, maintaining the attractiveness of domestic products even if foreign prices temporarily decrease. d. It supports the long-term viability of domestic manufacturers by providing a stable demand signal, encouraging continued investment in U.S. production capacity.   3. Improving Eligibility and Information Accessibility   In the proposed rule, CMS acknowledges the difficulties hospitals face in determining whether the N95 respirators they purchase are wholly domestically made and the need for more accessible information. AMMA strongly supports the creation of a publicly accessible database of eligible products. Such a resource would greatly simplify the procurement process, making it easier for hospitals to identify and purchase products that qualify for payment adjustments. This step ensures transparency and facilitates compliance with CMS's requirements. We also recommend flexibility to enable hospitals to submit a written statement from the manufacturer to account for the time it may take to establish a public list and maintain the list.    \n 3   4. Expanding Payment Adjustments to Include Non-Surgical N95 Respirators   AMMA strongly recommends that CMS expand the payment adjustment to encompass all domestic National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved N95 respirators, both surgical and non-surgical. The exclusion of non-surgical respirators overlooks their importance in various healthcare settings, particularly during public health emergencies. Expanding the scope of the payment adjustments would ensure a more comprehensive and resilient domestic supply chain.   5. Inclusion of Nitrile Gloves in the Payment Adjustment   The proposed rule highlights the importance of maintaining a resilient supply of nitrile gloves and considers the potential inclusion of nitrile gloves in the payment adjustment framework. AMMA fully supports this inclusion. Nitrile gloves are an essential component of PPE, and their domestic production must be sustained to avoid the supply chain vulnerabilities experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend that CMS adopt a national standard unit cost differential for nitrile gloves similar to what is being proposed for N95 respirators to ensure that the adjustments reflect the true costs of domestic production.   6. Phased Approach to Domestic Content Requirements for Nitrile Gloves   In the proposed rule, CMS references the potential challenges in sourcing all components of nitrile gloves domestically, particularly nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR). AMMA recommends a phased approach to domestic content requirements for nitrile gloves, with a plan to gradually increase the domestic content as U.S. manufacturing capabilities expand. This approach would provide a realistic pathway to full compliance with domestic content requirements while supporting the growth of the domestic glove manufacturing industry.   7. Expanding Payment Adjustments to Other PPE and Medical Devices   AMMA strongly supports CMS's consideration of expanding payment adjustments to include a broader array of PPE and critical medical devices. While focusing on N95 respirators and nitrile gloves is vital, other essential medical devices such as syringes, needles, and items like  \n 4 surgical masks, face shields, and gowns are equally critical to healthcare delivery and emergency preparedness.   The COVID-19 pandemic exposed severe vulnerabilities in the medical device supply chain, leading to significant shortages of critical items. These disruptions posed risks to patients and healthcare providers, underscoring the need for a more resilient supply chain. As outlined in the Critical Medical Device List (CMDL) developed by the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector Joint Supply Chain Resilience Working Group, 142 device types across care delivery, diagnostic assessment, laboratory testing, infection control, and medical imaging were identified as critical.   The Task Group behind the CMDL emphasized that U.S. medical supply chains are fragile and overly dependent on single-source providers, geographic dependencies, and sole manufacturers. The report identified devices especially prone to supply chain disruptions, such as single-use medical devices like syringes, needles, and disposable PPE, which were significantly impacted during the pandemic. The broader inclusion of such critical devices in CMS's payment adjustments would help reduce reliance on foreign imports and build a more robust domestic supply chain capable of withstanding future shocks.   To identify additional medical devices for inclusion, AMMA encourages CMS to adopt a filtering process similar to the one recommended in the CMDL report:   I. Identify critical medical products necessary for patient care and safety. II. Evaluate which products are primarily imported from countries with tenuous trade relations, such as China, a primary source of imported medical devices during the pandemic.   Prioritizing U.S.-manufactured alternatives for these products will significantly strengthen the supply chain and ensure hospitals can access critical medical devices during emergencies.   This approach aligns fully with President Biden's Executive Order on a Sustainable Public Health Supply Chain (EO 14001) and the National Strategy for a Resilient Public Health Supply Chain. CMS has a unique opportunity to take bold steps to strengthen the healthcare supply chain by expanding payment adjustments to cover a wide array of medical devices essential for both routine patient care and emergency preparedness.       \n 5 8. Focused Payment Adjustments for Syringes and Needles   In addition to broader payment adjustments for PPE, it is critical that CMS specifically address syringes and needles. These drug-delivery devices are indispensable for vaccinations, medication administration, and daily clinical tasks necessary for patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored how vital it is to maintain a steady supply of these devices for routine healthcare and emergency responses.   During the pandemic, the U.S. government invested $239 million as part of a broader $339 million investment to support domestic production of needles and syringes, expected to increase capacity by 575 million units (Retractable Technologies, Inc., Retractable Technologies, Inc. Low Dead-Space, Smiths Medical, ApiJect, BD). These investments were part of strategic, public-private partnerships with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense's Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND), to develop new manufacturing lines for injection devices that will provide priority access to the U.S. government for hundreds of millions of syringes and needles to support current and future pandemic vaccination efforts.   Yet, imports of syringes and needles increased sharply over the pandemic, especially from China, with the value of imported needles and syringes from China doubling from 2018 to 2023 (IBIS World Industry Report, 2023). The U.S. government invoked the Defense Production Act, which compelled domestic manufacturers to prioritize urgent care segments. This limited domestic manufacturers' ability to fully supply the healthcare market outside the hospital setting, resulting in market entry by foreign-manufactured products to non-urgent settings (clinics, drug stores). Leveraging this initial market access, the imports rapidly moved into the urgent care segment. The Mercator Institute for China Studies published a report that found that in 2021 China overtook both the United States and the EU for exports of syringes, partially prompted by state aid (Investigating state support for China's medical technology companies | Merics).    The influx of foreign-made syringes has eroded the U.S. domestic manufacturing base despite these significant investments. FDA reports have raised safety concerns about the quality of these imported products, with issues ranging from leaks to breakages, which compromise patient safety. Additionally, over the last several years major U.S. syringe and needle manufacturers have closed their plants, leaving the country with only one major domestic producer that can supply at-scale.     \n 6 CMS must prioritize these devices within the payment adjustment framework to ensure that hospitals have reliable access to high-quality, domestically produced syringes and needles. Including syringes and needles in the scope of payment adjustments will help preserve the remaining U.S. manufacturing base, incentivize other manufacturers to prioritize domestic production, and protect access to high-quality, safe products.   Neither the Berry Amendment nor the Make PPE in America Act apply to medical devices, thus CMS should consider the Buy American provisions under Federal Acquisition Rules (48 CFR 25.003) which can serve as a framework to evaluate the domestic content of these devices. With this definition, it will be important to ensure CMS addresses how to navigate waivers such as the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) exemptions.  This will help ensure that the focus remains on content evaluation of medical supplies to meet the intent of the policy.     By expanding payment adjustments to include syringes and needles, CMS would not only help sustain domestic production but also safeguard public health and patient safety. Ensuring a consistent supply of these critical medical devices is essential for the well-being of patients, healthcare workers, and the entire healthcare system, particularly during public health emergencies.   9. Addressing Awareness and Streamlining Participation Processes   CMS has identified that the limited use of payment adjustments may be partly due to low awareness and complex reporting requirements. AMMA recommends that CMS implement a more comprehensive outreach strategy to increase awareness and simplify participation processes, ensuring broader adoption of the payment adjustments.   We suggest that CMS target future communications to reimbursement leads and, more importantly, to procurement and hospital purchasing decision-makers within healthcare systems. This dual-pronged approach ensures that both financial decision-makers and those responsible for product selection are made aware of the program and its benefits.   A more comprehensive outreach strategy could include developing educational materials, creating support mechanisms for hospitals with questions about the program, and collaborating with associations to disseminate information. By ensuring that all relevant stakeholders within healthcare systems are informed and engaged, CMS can significantly increase participation in the payment adjustment program and, consequently, strengthen the domestic medical supply chain.  \n 7   10. Recognizing the Role of Distributors and Ensuring Accurate Pricing Comparisons   Finally, AMMA recognizes that accurate pricing comparisons are critical for effectively implementing payment adjustments. CMS should collaborate with major medical distributors and Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) to ensure pricing transparency and support the adoption of domestic products. Regular recalibration of cost differentials based on current market data will help maintain the relevance and effectiveness of payment adjustments.   Conclusion AMMA strongly supports the objectives outlined in the proposed rule and commends CMS for its thoughtful approach to addressing these complex issues. We urge CMS to adopt comprehensive strategies that promote fair competition for domestic manufacturers. CMS can play a pivotal role in securing a resilient domestic healthcare supply chain that protects all Americans’ health and safety by implementing the recommended modifications to the payment adjustments.   Thank you for considering our comments. AMMA remains committed to working with CMS to ensure a resilient healthcare supply chain that meets the needs of all Americans.

AdvaMed is a trade association representing the world's leading innovators and manufacturers of medical devices, diagnostic products, digital health technologies, and health information systems. Together, our members manufacture much of the life-enhancing and life- saving health care technology purchased annually in the United States and globally. AdvaMed members range from the largest to the smallest medical technology producers and include hundreds of small companies with fewer than 20 employees.\nThe comments are in response to a notice issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on January 3, 2024, requesting public comment regarding a petition by the Public Interest Research Group (\"PIRG\"). PIRG petitioned the FTC to initiate a broad rulemaking proceeding with the goal of promulgating a rule that would impose requirements on manufacturers of many types of products to allow users a \"right to repair\" those devices. As envisioned by PIRG, the rule would include not only consumer devices such as television and home appliances, but also complex medical devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For the reasons discussed below, AdvaMed urges the Commission not to initiate a rulemaking proceeding that includes provisions creating a right to repair FDA-regulated medical devices.1 Our comments do not address a possible rule regarding other products.\n1 The term \"medical devices\" is a broad one. It conceivably includes many products that are not regulated by the FDA. Throughout our comments we refer to FDA-regulated medical devices as simply \"medical devices.\"\nAdvaMed\n0\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org ::\n@AdvaMedUpdate ::\nin AdvaMed\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 2 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\nAdvaMed has previously made submissions to the FTC staff regarding many of the issues raised by the repair and maintenance of medical devices, which we have attached.2 These include a \"Submission to the FTC Regarding Servicing Restrictions\" (Attachment 1) and a \"Supplementary Submission to the FTC Regarding the Repair of Medical Devices\" (Attachment 2). In connection with these submissions, AdvaMed representatives met with FTC staff virtually to discuss these issues and respond to their questions. Because the analysis and information in these submissions remain current, we include them as part of our comments. Our Imaging Section, which includes the largest U.S. manufacturers of medical imaging equipment, such as X-ray machines and MRIs, has also prepared an analysis of right to repair issues, which will be filed separately. We believe this analysis can be helpful to the FTC as a useful, detailed analysis of why such a rule would not be helpful to consumers or competition.\nII. Lack of Evidence of Unfairness or Deception\nThe FTC has asked for comment on a possible rulemaking proceeding based on 15 U.S.C. 57a(1)(B) of the FTC Act. That section provides authority to the FTC to promulgate rules regarding \"unfair or deceptive practices.\" The FTC notice does not propose rulemaking based on Section 6(g) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 46. Thus, we assume that the FTC is not contemplating a rule based on a finding of unfair methods of competition.\nThe FTC only has authority to promulgate a rule under § 57(a)(1)(B) if the practice \"causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.\"3 Although the terms \"unfairness\" and \"deception\" are not defined in the Act itself, the FTC has issued policy statements summarizing the relevant case law and the FTC's own interpretation of them. Ultimately, the courts determine the meaning of these terms, but the FTC will no doubt rely upon its own interpretation in any rulemaking proceeding. The meaning of these terms, therefore, are of central importance in deciding whether to initiate a rulemaking proceeding. In order to promulgate a rule, the FTC must have substantial evidence that practices regulated by the rule are \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" or both.\nThere is no serious allegation that manufacturers of medical devices engage in deceptive practices regarding repair policies. The PIRG petition includes no evidence of deception and no serious allegations have been made by others. Therefore, we do not address the possibility that the FTC\n2 The idea of \"right to repair\" typically includes maintenance as well as repair. Below we refer to \"repair\" to include maintenance.\n3 15 U.S.C. 45(n). We assume that \"consumers\" in this context means patients who receive medical services.\nAdvaMed\nade of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 3 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\nmight base a rule on a finding of deceptive practices. Thus, any rule issued by the FTC would have to be based on a finding of unfair practices.\nThe Commission Statement of Policy on the Scope of the Unfairness Authority (Policy Statement) remains the most authoritative statement of what constitute \"unfair practices\" within the meaning of Section 5 of the FTC Act.4 The Policy Statement identifies three factors that should be applied in determining whether unfair practices are taking place: 1) whether the practice injures consumers; 2) whether it violates established public policy; and 3) whether it is unethical or unscrupulous. As discussed below, none of these factors exist.\nManufacturers of medical devices employ a wide variety of policies regarding their customers' repair of their products. In many cases, the manufacturer imposes no restrictions on repairs. In other cases, they do. The types of repair restrictions imposed by medical devices manufacturers are described in Attachment 1.5 Repair restrictions are related to the complexity of the device and the classification of the device by the FDA.\nMedical devices regulated by the FDA fall into three categories - Class I, Class II and Class III.6 Class I devices, which can be sold to consumers, are comparatively simpler devices, such as hospital beds and crutches, which may not require repairs or maintenance. Class II and Class III devices are subject to general pre-market and post-market regulatory controls. Some Class II devices are also subject to special pre-market and/or post-market controls. Additionally, some Class II devices are sold directly to consumers, but these are rarely subject to restrictions on repair and maintenance. In general, the only medical devices that are subject to restrictions on repair and maintenance are either Class II or Class III devices, which are sold to medical providers, such as hospitals and clinics. We presume that, if the FTC initiates a rulemaking proceeding that includes medical devices, the scope of the rule would be limited to these types of devices.\nWhen repair restrictions are applied to Class II or Class III devices, their primary purpose is to ensure that unqualified repair personnel do not create a risk to patients or health care personnel through repairing devices improperly. Any FTC blanket \"right to repair\" rule would need to take into account FDA's pre-market and post-market general controls that apply to all devices as well as any pre-market and post-market special controls that may apply to certain Class II devices. This would\n4 The Commission's notice does not refer to a rule based on a finding of \"unfair methods of competition.\" As we have shown in a previous submission, there is no credible claim that restrictions imposed on repairs by medical device manufacturers harm competition. See Attachment 1, pp. 2-4.\n5 See p, 6.\n6 The FDA's classification system is described in Kaiser v. Johnson \u0026 Johnson, 947 F.3d 996, 1004-05 (7th Cir. 2020). See also Classify Your Medical Device | FDA.\nAdvaMed\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 4 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\ncreate significant complexity and any such rule could conflict with FDA regulatory requirements since some of these post-market controls apply to repair and servicing.\nThere is no evidence that repair restrictions harm consumers.\nRepair restrictions by medical devices manufactures do not harm consumers. The reality is exactly the opposite. Repair restrictions benefit consumers by preventing repairs by unqualified persons that can cause these devices to become dangerous or to function improperly. There is considerable evidence that repairs by unqualified persons have harmed consumers. See Attachment 1, p. 6.\nClaims that repair restrictions harm consumers generally fall into two categories. The first is that restrictions designed to prevent unqualified persons from repairing devices increase the costs of repairs through reducing competition. That is a claim often made by Independent Service Operators (ISOs), which offer repair services. This industry has many participants, which are typically small businesses. See Attachment 1, p. 4.\nThe claim that repair restrictions raise the costs of repairs essentially amounts to a claim of unfair methods of competition, which we do not understand to be the FTC's focus. In any event, we have shown that these restrictions do not harm competition.7 The other claim is based on isolated examples where there is an allegation that repairs were delayed or prevented because the owner of the device could not comply with a manufacturer's repair policies. For example, one allegation is that, during the COVID pandemic, restrictions on repairs caused a delay in the repair of ventilators. We have investigated this claim and have found no evidence to support it. In fact, medical device manufacturers made substantial efforts during COVID to ensure that ventilators and other devices used to diagnose and treat patients were repaired and serviced promptly and properly.\nRestrictions on repairs and maintenance do not violate established public policy.\nThere is no established public policy that manufacturers should allow unqualified persons to repair medical devices. The principal policymaker regarding the quality of medical devices is the FDA. We discuss the role of the FDA in Attachment 1.8 The FDA has thoroughly reviewed the market for repairing medical devices because of its responsibility to ensure that regulated devices are safe and effective. Medical device original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") are subject to the FDA's Quality System Regulations (\"QSR\").9 The QSR requires that OEMs ensure the quality\n7 See Attachment 1, pp. 1-2, 7 and Attachment 2, Appendix.\nSee p. 7.\nSee 21 CFR Part 820.\nAdvaMed\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 5 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\nand safety of their products even after an initial sale to a medical provider. In other words, the public policy of the FDA is that manufacturers ensure that these devices are repaired and serviced properly. It does not mandate a \"hands off\" approach that would give buyers of these devices unfettered discretion in deciding how devices are repaired. AdvaMed's position is that the FDA should extend these policy standards to Independent Service Organizations (ISOs), but the FDA has not chosen to do so.\nRestrictions on repairs and maintenance of medical devices are not unethical or unscrupulous. There are no serious allegations that these kinds of restrictions, which are intended primarily to protect patients, are unethical or unscrupulous as those terms have been used in prior FTC cases.\nIn summary, there is no evidence that restrictions on repairs implemented by medical devices manufacturers are unfair within the meaning of the FTC Act. Therefore, the FTC has no legal basis for promulgating a rule covering repairs of medical devices.\nIII. Purchasers of Medical Devices are Highly Sophisticated and Competent\nThe FTC's traditional concern about unfairness is that consumers, because of a lack of information or a breakdown in competition, are vulnerable to harmful practices. That concern does not apply with respect to medical devices. Repair restrictions, where they exist, are typically applied to devices purchased by large, sophisticated purchasers, such as hospitals and clinics. If the FTC initiates a rulemaking proceeding that covers medical devices, the rule would have to address purchases by medical providers since consumers do not directly purchase complex medical devices. Medical provider entities that purchase these devices include large hospital networks with revenues exceeding one billion dollars. They typically have knowledgeable purchasing departments and legal counsel, which are extensively involved in drafting and negotiating contracts. Most hospitals rely on Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) to negotiate a large portion of their contracts. GPOs are also highly sophisticated in negotiating contracts, which include among their terms the way products will be repaired. In short, the purchasers of medical devices that would be the focus of any rule are quite capable of negotiating with sellers regarding how repairs will be done. 10 Thus, the traditional rationale for the use of the FTC's unfairness authority, that it is needed to protect vulnerable consumers from unfair practices, does not apply to repairs of medical devices.\n10 See Attachment 1, p. 3.\nAdvaMed\n0\node of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 6 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\nV. The Importance of Intellectual Property\nMany medical devices operate based on complex software programs. These programs are included in computer chips or drives that are stored within the device or they are executed by computers that are linked to the device. Most of these software programs are subject to protection by copyright laws. An FTC rule that attempts to bar restrictions on the use of these programs would have the practical result of preventing copyright owners from enforcing the rights associated with their copyrights. For example, a bar on enforcing a copyright would allow an ISO to copy computer programs and modify them.11 Thus, not only would an FTC rule undercut restrictions intended to protect patients, it would undermine the rights of copyright holders.\nIV. The Role of the FDA\nThe FDA is entrusted by Congress with the principal authority to ensure the quality and safety of medical devices. The FDA has exercised this authority by issuing its Quality System Regulations, which include a number of provisions related to repair and servicing.12 In AdvaMed's view, any additional federal regulation in this area would be more effective and consistent with current law if done by the FDA. As we noted above, AdvaMed has urged the FDA to take a more active role in regulating the activities of ISO.\nV. The Risks and Complexity of an FDA Rule\nIn its Nix the Fix report, the FTC staff described the options for the FTC in dealing with repair and servicing issues. These include rulemaking under the Magnuson-Moss Act and case-by-case enforcement.\nIn our view, applying the FTC Act to the repair of medical devices, if warranted, should proceed by case-by-case enforcement rather than a broad rule. Any rule that applies to medical devices would have to take into account the wide variety of medical devices and their classification by the FDA. In order to justify a rule applicable to these situations, the FTC would need to find that there is a widespread pattern of unfair practices by medical device manufacturers in restricting repairs of medical devices. As we explained above, there is no evidence of unfair practices.\nIf the FTC, despite this lack of evidence, proposes a rule that covers medical devices, the rule would have to take into account the wide variety of situations when medical devices are repaired.\n11 Some of these issues are addressed in pending litigation involving the implementation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by the Library of Congress. See Medical Imaging \u0026 Technology Alliance, et al v. Library of Congress, et al, Docket No. 23-05067 (D.C. Cir. Mar 31, 2023) .\n12 See Attachment 2, Appendix.\nAdvaMed\n0\node of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nFederal Trade Commission February 2, 2024 Page 7 of 7\nDocket No. FTC-2023-0077\nUnlike a comparatively simple situation when products are sold directly to consumers, an FTC rule would have to consider the clinical risks involved in improper repairs of such varied and highly complex devices including automated extended defibrillators, magnetic imaging devices, computerized tomography devices, and other diagnostic laboratory equipment. Untrained persons cannot repair these devices without creating risks for patients. It would be highly irresponsible of the FTC to promulgate a rule that allowed untrained and unqualified persons to repair these devices on the basis of some generalized \"right to repair.\" Thus, a rule would have to be based on a finding that particular training or qualification requirements imposed by manufacturers are \"unfair.\" We believe it is highly unlikely that courts would uphold a rule that is based on such a finding and that substitutes the FTC's judgment about these requirements for manufacturers' judgments.\nIn addition to the complexities involved in devising such a rule, the FTC would also have to include special provisions to avoid conflicts with the FDA's QSR regulations. We presume that the FTC does not wish to promulgate a rule that undermines existing FDA regulations. Finally, the rule would have to take into account the intellectual property rights of copyright holders. To the extent that an FTC rule could undermine existing intellectual property rights, the FTC would have to craft a rule that protected these rights or explain how it has the authority to limit them.\nIn short, there are a number of complexities in trying to address repair restrictions applicable to medical devices in a broad FTC rule, which we feel would be better addressed in case-by-case enforcement. We believe it would be extremely difficult for the FTC to develop a rule that does not create far more harm to consumers than benefits and that does not disrupt the efficient functioning of the market for medical devices.\nVI. Conclusion\nWe do not believe there is any legal basis for the FTC to promulgate a rule regarding repairs of medical devices. Any such rule is likely to do far more harm than good. Thus, AdvaMed recommends that the FTC deny the petition to the extent it proposes a right to repair rule that includes medical devices. AdvaMed takes no position regarding a rule that applies to other products.\nRespectfully submitted by: Tara Federici\nTara Federici Vice President Technology and Regulatory Affairs\nAdvaMe\node of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nATTACHMENT 1\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nSUBMISSION TO THE FTC REGARDING SERVICING RESTRICTIONS\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis paper discusses the policies of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) regarding the maintenance and repair of FDA-regulated medical devices.1 The primary buyers of these devices are hospital networks, individual hospitals and other health care providers. OEMs take various approaches to how their products will be serviced, including: 1) servicing the products themselves; 2) relying on OEM-authorized Independent Service Organizations (ISOs)2; or 3) leaving it up to buyers to arrange for servicing even though the repair entities are not authorized by the OEMs and may be unqualified.3 The primary dispute regarding \"right to repair\" is whether unauthorized servicing entities in this last category should be able to service devices and have access to information and manuals prepared by the OEMs.\nUnauthorized servicing entities have argued that OEM policies on how buyers obtain servicing harm competition and patients.4 As we demonstrate in this paper, however, the general approach of OEMs toward the servicing of medical devices complies with FDA regulatory requirements and furthers competition by ensuring that patients are protected and that products are serviced properly. As we discuss below, the medical device manufacturing industry is highly competitive, and manufacturers do not make excess profits servicing products. Instead, limitations on how buyers can service products is intended to ensure that OEMs' products are serviced properly.\nIf a device is repaired or serviced improperly, at best, the device is ineffective, and the patient receives no benefit. At worst, improper servicing or repairs can cause serious injury or even death to patients. Thus, OEM limitations on repairs in the medical device industry are good for competition and for patients.\n1 After they are put in use, medical devices require both regular maintenance and repairs. This paper uses the term \"servicing\" to refer to both types of activities.\n2 Independent Servicing organizations are comprised of individuals, small and medium sized businesses, and very large businesses. FDA has estimated that there are between 16,520 and 20,830 entities performing device servicing.\n3. When health care entities decline OEM servicing and repair, the servicing is not subject to FDA regulation or oversight.\n4 These policies typically include ensuring that those who service devices are properly trained, are using qualified replacement parts, and limiting distribution of repair manuals and specialized tools to appropriately trained individuals to assure safe and effective medical devices. These policies are also required by FDA Quality System Regulations.\nAdvaMed\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org ::\n@AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\nATTACHMENT 1\nThis paper also discusses the FDA's regulatory approach for servicing. OEMs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, not only for manufacturing activities, but for their repair and service activities as well.5 FDA has the authority to regulate unauthorized servicing entities but has chosen to use its enforcement discretion not to do so.6 AdvaMed has recommended to the FDA that it impose the same servicing standards on unauthorized servicing entities that it imposes on OEMs. FDA recently issued draft guidance to help unauthorized servicing entities distinguish between servicing and remanufacturing of medical devices because \"FDA concluded that a majority of the comments, complaints, and adverse event reports received by the Agency that referred to inadequate 'servicing' causing or contributing to adverse events and deaths actually pertained to remanufacturing\".7 Many unauthorized servicing entities fail to understand that the servicing they are performing is actually remanufacturing which FDA actively regulates. However, it did not take the additional step of directly regulating the servicing activities of unauthorized servicing entities. In our view, the most productive step the federal government can take in regard to servicing and repairs of medical devices is for the FDA to impose quality and reporting requirements on these entities.\nII. THE APPLICABLE ANTITRUST STANDARDS\nThe principal issues raised in the debate over OEM policies has been the effect on the costs and quality of repairs. Possible antitrust violations by the OEMs in connection with repair policies are typically analyzed as either monopolization or tying claims. In practice, the analysis for both violations is very similar. The question is whether a manufacturer is driving up repair\n5 See 21 CFR § 820.1. (\"Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements are set forth in this quality system regulation. The requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.\") (emphasis added). 6 The FDA has acknowledged that it has the authority to regulate third-party repair entities but has decided to defer enforcement with respect to these entities. During the May 2, 2017 Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee hearing titled \"Examining Improvements to the Regulation of Medical Technologies,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, responded to Representative Gene Green's question about the rules and requirements that currently apply to third party service providers, stating \"So, in our regulation on quality systems, we had made clear that third-party servicers are manufacturers, but they have been subject to enforcement discretion. (emphasis added) We have not enforced those requirements.\" 7 FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for servicing and repair but has consistently maintained regulatory authority over remanufacturing activities (i.e., remanufacturers). FDA defines remanufacturer at 21 CFR 820.3(w). FDA's website states \"The FDA enforces requirements under the FD\u0026C Act and its implementing regulations on entities engaged in remanufacturing, including but not limited to registration and listing, adverse event reporting, the Quality System (QS) regulation, and marketing submissions.\" See: https://www.fda.gov/medical- devices/quality-and-compliance-medical-devices/remanufacturing-and-servicing-medical-devices\nPage 2 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\ncosts over competitive levels by unfairly excluding rivals from selling repair services to the manufacturer's buyer or whether the manufacturer's repair policies benefit competition and patients.\nThe Kodak Decision\nTying cases involve situations when the seller conditions the purchase of one product (the \"tied\" product) to the purchase of another product (the \"tying\" product). Despite some early cases suggesting that harmful ties might occur frequently, more recent court opinions have found harm to competition only in a narrow set of circumstances.8 The Supreme Court's 1992 Kodak decision dealt with an OEM's repair policies that at least indirectly tied repairs to the purchase of original equipment.9 In that case, Kodak initially allowed independent repair entities to purchase replacement parts. These entities could then service Kodak products. However, after selling many of its products, it changed its policies and refused to sell parts directly to third party repair entities. Consequently, some of Kodak's buyers were forced to purchase the parts from Kodak. The Court expressed concern that buyers were \"locked into\" their Kodak device after the original purchase and, therefore, Kodak had the equivalent of a monopoly in the \"installed base\" of its products and its policies harmed competition in repairing them.\nLater opinions and commentary on Kodak have been skeptical of the idea that repairs of a single manufacturer's products can constitute a relevant market. They argue that sophisticated buyers will take into account any excessive costs of repairs in their original purchasing decision as long as the repair policy is disclosed to buyers.10\nMedical Device Purchase Contracts\nThe primary purchasers of FDA-regulated medical devices are hospitals or other health care providers, which typically rely on a procurement system staffed by experts. Sophisticated buyers, such as hospital networks or Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), are able to make an assessment of short-term and long-term costs at the time of purchase. As we discuss further below, customers are given a range of options when they purchase medical devices, including taking full responsibility for repairs. Limitations on repairs are frequently the subject of negotiation between OEMs and their buyers. Negotiations can include cost of repairs, and servicing response times by the OEM or OEM-authorized servicers. Thus, OEMs in the medical device industry have little to gain by unnecessarily restricting repairs of their products. Forcing\n8 Recent opinions are discussed in the FTC's Staff Report, Nix the Fix (July 2021), pp. 9-16.\n9 Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. 504 U.S. 451 (1992).\n10 See, e.g., Alcatel USA, Inc. v. DGI Technologies, 166 F.3d 772 (5th Cir. 1999) (affirmed summary judgment for defendant where defendant had not changed its policies after the purchase).\nPage 3 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\nbuyers to incur extraordinary repair costs discourages hospitals and other health care providers from making the initial medical device purchase. Effect of Repair Policies on Competition\nThe consensus view today is that there is unlikely to be harm to competition if the OEM market is competitive.11 The FTC staff report concludes: \"If a purchaser signed a contract containing aftermarket obligations for parts at the servicing at the initial sale, courts likely will not find liability if the purchaser had other options .... On the other hand, if aftermarket costs were unavailable up front, the courts may find that the purchaser is locked-in and liability is possible. Also, if there has been no change in policy by the manufacturer, the courts are unlikely to find the policy exclusionary.\"12\nIt is impossible to characterize every product market in the medical device industry since there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of product markets for devices where repair policies are conceivably an issue. However, the general characteristics of medical device markets make it highly unlikely that OEM repair policies constitute unlawful ties or monopolization. The product markets are generally competitive, and buyers are informed about repair policies and costs when they purchase products.\nMedical device product manufacturing markets are highly competitive. Prices for medical devices have grown far more slowly than the Medical Consumer Price Index and even the overall Consumer Price Index. Over the period from 2009 to 2019, medical device prices have increased at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent, compared to 2.9 percent for the MC-CPI and 1.8 percent for the CPI. Consistent with these differences in price trends, medical device spending increased at an annual rate of only 3.1 percent from 2009 to 2019 in nominal dollars, considerably lower than the increase of 4.3 percent in aggregate national health accounts. 13 There is also strong evidence of price competitiveness in product markets where servicing restrictions are most frequently used, such as diagnostic equipment and complex treatment devices such as ventilators. A J.P. Morgan market assessment for 2019 found that the medical diagnostic industry faced \"headwinds\" of \"increasing competition\" and \"overlaps among platforms [that] pressures prices.\"14\nThere is also significant competition for the repair of medical devices. The FDA has estimated that there are between 16,520 and 20,830 firms performing device servicing. Only modest capital investment is required to perform servicing and repairs and other barriers to entry\n11 The FTC staff report concurs with this view. See p. 14.\n12 Id.\n13 Gerald F. Donahoe, Estimates of Medical Device Spending in the United States (June 2021) (analysis supported by AdvaMed).\n14 Diagnostics Market Overview \u0026 Key Themes, J.P. Morgan, North American Equity Research (June 2019).\nPage 4 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\nare low as well. Competition in product sales and repair services mean that the conditions for unlawful tying or monopolization are unlikely to exist. III. OEM REPAIR POLICIES\nProper maintenance and repair of FDA-regulated medical devices are often essential to proper functioning. They are especially important in the case of complex Class III medical devices such as automated extended defibrillators (AED's) and Class II medical devices such as: 1) diagnostic devices, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging devices (MRIs), computerized tomography devices (CTs), and other diagnostic laboratory equipment; 2) complex equipment used in the surgical suite; and 3) other complex devices used in treatment, such as ventilators. These devices often utilize their own embedded software as well as highly precise components. Repairs require considerable training in the complexities of the function and design of the devices. None of these devices are \"normally used for personal, family, or household purposes.\" Thus, they are not \"consumer products\" within the meaning of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.\nSupport Strategies and Buyer Options\nOEMs are required by the FDA to develop a \"support strategy\" for their buyers, which sets out how a device is maintained and serviced. Customers typically are given a number of options. First, the customer may choose to purchase services provided by OEM employees or by third parties authorized by the OEM. Second, if the OEM and the customer believe the customer's in-house staff is able to repair the product, the OEM can authorize the customer's employees to take responsibility for repairs. For example, a hospital network may have its own large, sophisticated repair and servicing department. Third, the customer can rely on its own unauthorized employees or unauthorized third parties to do repairs. The buyer may choose any of these options.\nIf the buyer takes the first or second approach described above and relies on authorized training personnel, the FDA requires the OEM to ensure that all persons who conduct repairs are qualified to repair the products. The FDA also requires the OEM to monitor the parts that are used. If the buyer chooses the third approach, which relies on unauthorized servicing entities, the OEM is not involved in the repair process and takes no responsibility for the quality of the repairs. In those cases, the OEM's warranty is typically void.\nOEM warranties are not valid in the case of servicing performed by unauthorized servicing entities for two reasons. The most important reason by far is that an improperly repaired product can create serious risk of injury or death for patients. In addition to the very serious human costs, an OEM can be subject to liability if its employees or authorized repair personnel are responsible for the product failure. Second, even if a patient is not harmed, a\nPage 5 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\nproduct failure can create serious reputational damage for the OEM because buyers and patients are uncertain about the primary responsibility for the problem. Since the most prominent and obvious entity associated with the product is the OEM, patients and buyers often associate a malfunction with the OEM even if the real cause is an improper repair.\nRisks to Patients\nThe concern about risks to patients is not just theoretical. According to FDA's report to Congress on the Quality, Safety, and Effectiveness of Servicing of Medical Devices, required by Section 710 of the Food and Drug Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA found 4,301 adverse events associated with inadequate third-party device repairs and replacement parts, including 40 deaths and 294 serious injuries. These numbers were found despite the fact that unauthorized servicing entities are not required to submit Medical Device Reports (MDRs). Thus, the actual number of adverse events is probably much higher. Additionally, AdvaMed has shared information with FDA from six manufacturers who recorded at least 281 adverse events from 2012 to 2017 associated with third party servicing. For some devices (e.g., imaging devices), up to 38,500 patients and/or operators were exposed to the potential for harm.15 This report represented a tiny fraction of all such adverse events.\nControlling Quality of Repairs\nAn OEM that wishes to ensure the quality of repairs of its products has a limited number of options. First, it can embed software in its product to make sure that only authorized repair entities can service a device. Second, as described above, it can limit the effectiveness of its warranty to cases where the buyer uses authorized personnel and parts. Third, an OEM can also restrict distribution of repair manuals and service information.\nMuch of the dispute between OEMs and unauthorized servicing entities involves the distribution of repair manuals. There are a number of reasons that OEMs frequently limit the distribution of these manuals. First, repair manuals may contain proprietary information regarding the way products are designed and manufactured including design schematics. Distribution of these materials undercuts the confidentiality of this information and can encourage counterfeiting. Second, and most importantly, widely distributing repair manuals encourages companies to attempt repairs even if they are not authorized by the OEM and their repair personnel are unqualified. Unauthorized servicing entities often claim that these restrictions unfairly prevent them from repairing an OEM's products. However, controlling the quality of repairs is helpful to both competition and patients. They benefit patients by reducing\n15. This report was based on a very small fraction of ISOs. As noted above, the FDA has estimated that there are between 16,520 and 20,830 firms performing device servicing.\nPage 6 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\nthe risk of serious injury or death and they benefit competition by enabling competing manufacturers to offer higher quality, safer products.\nIV. FDA REGULATION\nMedical device manufacturers are subject to the FDA's Quality System Regulations (QSR). The QSR covers the entire device lifecycle of medical devices from device design, manufacturing and installation to servicing.16 The QSR is risk-based and scalable. It applies to all device manufacturers regardless of size. QSR compliance is understood to be a fundamental requirement of doing business in the device sector. The FDA has stated that \"quality systems ... help ensure that ... products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications.\"\nBecause OEMs are required by the FDA to ensure that repairs of their products comply with the QSR, OEMs cannot give buyers unlimited discretion in determining how products are repaired. If OEMs perform repairs, they must comply with the QSR. If OEMs rely on OEM- authorized third parties to perform repairs, they require that these third parties meet the same servicing standards that OEMs are required to meet. Widely distributing repair manuals and repair information to any unauthorized servicing entities that wishes to repair products is not only dangerous for patients, doing so would likely violate an OEM's obligations under the QSR.\nThe FDA has not yet chosen to directly subject unauthorized servicing entities to the QSR. Consequently, unauthorized servicing entities are not required to register with FDA, to submit adverse events associated with devices they repair to FDA or the OEM, or to comply with other FDA quality system regulations such as training of employees, maintenance of device repair records, and assuring that suppliers providing replacement parts are qualified and appropriate. It is not clear whether the FDA's position is based on the burden of regulating such a large industry or some other consideration. AdvaMed has urged the FDA to apply the same QSR standards that are applicable to OEMs directly to unauthorized servicing entities. In our view, direct regulation of unauthorized servicing entities by the FDA would significantly advance the goal of patient safety.\nV. THE EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC\nThe pandemic imposed serious stresses on the health care system in many ways, including increasing the need for the repair of certain devices, such as ventilators. Some have suggested that OEM repair policies contributed to the delays in repairs. We are not aware of reliable evidence to support this claim. Our members report that they were able to conduct all necessary repairs within contracted timelines except where hospitals prohibited entry of non-\n16 See 21 CFR 820.1.\nPage 7 of 8\nATTACHMENT 1\nhospital personnel. During the pandemic, many OEMs made special efforts to assist hospitals in making repairs themselves or arranging for them.\nThe U.S. PIRG organization prepared a report claiming that there were delays in servicing medical devices, particularly ventilators, during the pandemic because of the refusal of OEMs to provide repair manuals to unauthorized servicing entities. We do not believe the data used by U.S. PIRG is reliable. Their conclusions depended heavily on a survey of independent service entities, which had an obvious bias in furnishing their responses.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe FTC's recent policy statement regarding repair restrictions suggested three possible courses of action for the Commission:1) increasing enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act; 2) challenging OEM repair policies as antitrust violations; and 3) challenging OEM repair policies as unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\nWith respect to the first item, as noted above, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act does not apply to FDA-regulated medical devices.\nWith respect to the second item, although, in theory, there could be unlawful tying or monopolization leading to harm to competition in a medical device servicing market, the characteristics of both medical device servicing markets and the compelling reasons for existing OEM servicing policies mean that, if violations exist, they are exceedingly rare. Thus, there is no justification to prioritize antitrust enforcement in this industry.\nFinally, with respect to the third item, there is no evidence of deception in OEM repair restrictions in this industry, and unauthorized servicing entities have not pointed to any.\nWhile unauthorized servicing entities may lose some business opportunities, the overall effect of OEM servicing policies is to benefit competition, comply with FDA QSR requirements, and most important, safeguard patients.\nWe are pleased to furnish any additional information17 that the FTC would like that is relevant to these issues and we hope to meet with FTC staff in the near future.\n17 Please feel free to contact Edward Correia, Correia \u0026 Osolinik at ecorreiadc.com, 301-943-8647, or Tara Federici, Vice President, Technology and Regulatory Affairs, AdvaMed at tfederici@advamed.org or 202-434-7208.\nPage 8 of 8\nATTACHMENT 2\nAdvaMed Advanced Medical Technology Association\nSUPPLEMENTARY SUBMISSION TO THE FTC REGARDING THE REPAIR OF MEDICAL DEVICES\nWe are grateful for the opportunity to meet recently with FTC staff to discuss the repair and servicing of medical devices. During the meeting, the staff asked about the process to become qualified to repair complex medical devices, including the cost and length of training. In addition, we discussed the extensive role played by the FDA in regulating the repair process. As we noted, the FDA imposes substantial burdens on manufacturers to make sure repairs are performed properly, and, importantly, it has chosen not to regulate third party servicing entities1 that engage in repairs and servicing. This paper addresses these two issues.\nI. REPAIRS BY CUSTOMERS AND THIRD PARTIES\nAs we noted in our submission of December 2022 to the FTC staff, the FDA requires manufacturers of medical devices to develop for their customers a repair strategy for the devices they sell as part of their overall obligation to provide safe and effective products. Repair strategy is discussed by manufacturers and customers during contract negotiations. The strategy that is adopted by the customer - for example, a hospital network - depends, among other things, on the preferences of the customer, the complexity of the device, and the skill of the customer's in- house personnel.\nCustomers have several options in repairing and servicing products - contracting with the seller to service products, taking responsibility for repairing its own products through use of its own staff, adopting a hybrid approach where the customer's staff works with the manufacturer's staff, and relying on independent repair entities, multi-vendor organizations, or managed service organizations. There is significant variation in customers' reliance on manufacturer, customer and independent service organization (ISO) repair personnel.\nIf the manufacturer and customer cannot agree on a service model, the customer typically can still purchase the product and take complete responsibility for servicing, or it may choose to purchase similar equipment from a different manufacturer. Because customers have repair and servicing options, manufacturers cannot make excessive returns in repairing their products.\n1 There are two general categories of servicing entities: 1) those authorized by the OEM and 2) unauthorized servicing entities. Authorized servicing entities include the OEM's servicing employees, their customers' biomedical engineers and independent servicing organization (ISOs), both large and small. The latter two will have been trained by the OEM and may also receive access to special tools. Unauthorized servicing entities may include large and small ISOs and customer biomedical engineers and will not have received training.\nAdvaMed\nCode\nde of Ethics\nCERTIFIED\nadvamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: in AdvaMed\nATTACHMENT 2\nInstead, manufacturer policies regarding repairs are intended to ensure that devices are repaired properly in order to avoid harm to patients and to the reputation of the manufacturer.\nII. COSTS AND LENGTH OF TRAINING PROGRAMS\nThe FTC staff asked about the costs and length of training for service personnel. In general, the training offered by manufacturers is the same for in-house personnel, customer personnel, and independent entities. Based on the data provided by our members, training lasted from a few days to less than a year, depending on the risk of the device and its complexity and the number of devices involved. The cost of training ranged from $4,000 to $24,000 depending on the products involved. Costs are at the higher end of the range if the trainee is provided customer service tools (generally the manufacturer's intellectual property) to use after the training. Training costs and length are commensurate with the sophistication of the device (for example, devices range from simple blood pressure cuffs to complex computerized tomography (CT) scan machines) and typically comprises a small percentage of the total cost of ownership.\nManufacturers typically develop training programs for their own employees and make these training programs available to customers as part of a coordinated repair strategy. Medical device manufacturers are not regularly engaged in the business of occupational training and, therefore, do not make their programs available to the general public. In addition, making training available directly to the public, including ISOs who are not affiliated with a particular customer, would raise significant issues regarding the unlicensed use of intellectual property and actions that undermine cybersecurity.\nTypically, training is designed to include access to higher level tools and diagnostics, both of which are part of the manufacturer's intellectual property. Consequently, most training is accompanied by an intellectual property license and secured privileged access. Ensuring cybersecurity is essential because failing to properly protect medical equipment can lead to serious adverse consequences for patients and for patients' confidential healthcare information.\nIII. THE FDA QSR REQUIREMENTS\nThe FDA imposes substantial requirements on manufacturers of medical devices regulated by the agency. The Quality System Regulation (QSR) applies to manufacturers' involvement in repair and servicing medical devices, just as it does to manufacturing.2 A manufacturer can violate the QSR if its own employees fail to meet regulatory standards when they repair devices or if the manufacturer authorizes or enables others to engage in repair practices that do not meet these standards. For example, if manufacturers enable unqualified\n2 See the attached Appendix with the complete list of QSR servicing-related requirements.\n2 ::\nATTACHMENT 2\nISOs to repair products by making repair information available to unqualified repair entities, the manufacturer might violate one or more of the QSR requirements.\nThere is no FDA or other regulatory requirement that ISOs receive any particular training or certification or comply with any of the other QSR requirements. Manufacturers that repair products are required to report product failures to the agency, but ISOs are not. Until September 2020, we have had no way of knowing how many product failures are the result of inadequate ISO servicing.3 The limited data that are available show that there are frequent problems caused by unqualified ISOs.4\nThe FDA has authority to apply these standards to independent repair entities, but it has chosen not to do so. As a result, the large, fragmented industry of independent service organizations (ISOs) is unregulated.5 AdvaMed has consistently advocated that the FDA use its authority to regulate the ISO industry in order to avoid the risks that unregulated ISOs pose to patients. If ISOs are permitted to service complex medical devices, they should be subject to the same regulatory standards applied to manufacturers.\n3 FDA has modified its adverse event form to include a check box if the device was serviced by a third party. However, third parties are not required to submit adverse events and OEMs may not be able to forensically and conclusively identify adverse events related to third party servicing.\n4 See our earlier submission, p. 6.\n5 As we noted in our first submission, the FDA estimates there are between 16,520 and 20,830 firms performing device servicing.\n3 ::\nATTACHMENT 2\nAppendix QSR Servicing Related Requirements\nOEMs are subject to all aspects of FDA's Quality System Regulation (QSR) (21 CFR 820) no matter their size or number of personnel. FDA is using its enforcement discretion and does not apply any elements of the QSR to third party servicing entities.\nKey requirements of the QSR that relate to servicing include good manufacturing practices and design controls.\nGood Manufacturing Practices Include Servicing\n. Under the QSR, good manufacturing practices requirements apply to servicing.\n·\nSee Subpart A - General Provisions\nSec. 820.1 Scope.\nApplicability. (1) Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements are set forth in this quality system regulation. The requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing [emphasis added] of all finished devices intended for human use. ·\n·\n·\n. Under the QSR, device manufacturers are required to have sufficient personnel that are appropriately trained to perform servicing.\nSee Subpart B - Quality System Requirements, Sec. 820.25 Personnel.\n·\n·\n(a) General. Each manufacturer shall have sufficient personnel with the necessary education, background, training, and experience to assure that all activities required by this part are correctly performed [emphasis added]. ·\n(b) Training.

Regardless of who developed the initial product concept, product developers play a key role in developing the design input requirements. When presented with a set of important characteristics, it is the product developers who understand the auxiliary issues that must be addressed, as well as the level of detail necessary to design a product. Therefore, a second key principle is that the product developer(s) ultimately bear responsibility for translating user and/or patient needs into a set of requirements which can be validated prior to implementation. While this is primarily an engineering function, the support or full participation of production and service personnel [emphasis added], key suppliers, etc., may be required to assure that the design input requirements are complete.\" ·\n·\n·\n· See DESIGN CONTROL GUIDANCE FOR MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS (p. 20)\n\"Design output includes production specifications as well as descriptive materials which define and characterize the design. ·\nPRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.

AdvaMed Medical Imaging Division represents the \nmanufacturers of medical imaging equipment, including, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical X -\nRay equipment, computed tomography (CT) scanners, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, radiopharmaceuticals, \nand im aging information systems. Our members have introduced innovative medical imaging \ntechnologies for use by healthcare  providers , and they play an essential role in our nation’s health care \ninfrastructure and the care pathways of screening, staging, evaluating, managing, and effectively treating \npatients with cancer, heart disease, neurological degeneration, COVID -19, and numerous other medical \nconditions.  \n \nMedical imaging technologies play a crucial role in advancing health equity . Imaging technologies are \nused in screening for numerous diseases, many of which affect different populations disproportionately. \nIn many cases, these technologies are used throughout the care pathway to provide more discerning \ndiagnoses and inform treatment. A prime example is the ongoing advancement  in diagnostic and \nsupplemental breast imaging following a determination of high breast density. While the rate of breast \ncancer for women of color is similar to white women, Black women are often diagnosed with breast \ncancer at more advanced stages when treatment options are more limited, costly, and result in death rates \n40% higher than white women.1 Black women may face worse disease progression in part because of \ntheir increased likelihood of having dense breast tissue2. Advancements in breast MRI, ultrasound, \nnuclear medicine, digital breast tomosynthesis, and other technologies are helping to address this \ndisparity.  \n \nFurther, imaging is helping to advance health equity by enabling care to happen where  patients are. \nMobile imaging units can bring advanced imaging such as MRI and CT as well as screening to rural and \notherwise underserved communities. Teleradiology and artificial intelligence will also help to bring \nstandard of care to the population, no matter where they live.  \n \nIn this discussion paper, CDRH describes factors and considerations that may be important for sponsors \nand other relevant parties as they develop medical device clinical studies and seeks feedback from the \npublic. Specifically, the discussion paper request s feedback on possible considerations that may help \ninform the design of a clinical study that adequately reflects the intended use population for a particular \nmedical device.  \n \n1 https://www.komen.org/about -komen/our -impact/breast -cancer/stand -for-h-e-r/ \n2 https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/107/10/djv296/987327?login=false    \n \n advamed.org   ::      @AdvaMedUpdate   ::      AdvaMed  2 :: \n \n \n \nAs FDA seeks input on health equity and medical devices, it should also recognize the important role \nstandards play in governing the safety and efficacy of medical devices.  In certain cases, imaging devices, \nincluding some artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, may require clinical studies.  In most cases,  \nhowever,  imaging products do not require clinical studies while going through pre -market review. These \nare well established technologies that have been used in clinical care for decades.   \nThe safety and efficacy of imaging technologies are supported by a robust consensus standards \necosystem. These standards establish clear and consistent requirements for numerous aspects of all \nimaging modalities and are an important part of FDA pre -market review for imaging technologies.  \n \nWe would welcome the opportunity to work with the FDA and other interested and affected stakeholders \nthrough established consensus standards development processes to develop standards that advance health \nequity.  \n \n* * * \n \nIf you have any questions, please contact Peter Weems, Vice President, Government Affairs \u0026 Policy \nStrategy at pweems@advamed.org .  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nPeter Weems  \nVice President, Government Affairs \u0026 Policy Strategy  \nAdvaMed Medical Imaging Division  \n \n \n",

These actions represent a substantial shift in the federal government's approach to AI, focusing on deregulation, investment in AI infrastructure, and reestablishing the United States' global leadership in AI technology. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of these developments, including executive orders issued by President Donald J. Trump, the establishment of new advisory councils, and reactions from advocacy organizations.\n\n## Rescission of Previous AI Policies\n\n### Revocation of Biden's Executive Order on AI\n\nOn January 23, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled **\"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\"** ([Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence - The White House]). This executive order revoked former President Joe Biden's Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023, titled \"Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\nThe Trump administration viewed the Biden-era AI policies as impediments to innovation and competitiveness. The new executive order states:\n\n> \"This order revokes certain existing AI policies and directives that act as barriers to American AI innovation, clearing a path for the United States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial intelligence.\"  \n> — ([Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence - The White House])\n\nAdditionally, the order mandates a review of all policies, directives, regulations, and actions taken under the revoked executive order to ensure they align with the new policy of enhancing America's AI dominance.\n\n### Fact Sheet on Enhancing AI Leadership\n\nAccompanying the executive order, the White House released a fact sheet titled **\"Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Action to Enhance America’s AI Leadership\"** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Action to Enhance America’s AI Leadership - The White House]), which outlines the administration's rationale and objectives:\n\n- **Removing Harmful Policies**: The fact sheet asserts that the Biden administration's AI executive order imposed \"onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI,\" which stifled innovation.\n\n- **Policy Objectives**: The Trump administration's policy emphasizes sustaining and enhancing America's dominance in AI to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\n\n- **Developing an AI Action Plan**: The order calls for the development of an AI action plan within 180 days to achieve these objectives.\n\n## New Executive Orders and Policies\n\n### Executive Order: Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI\n\nThe executive order issued on January 23, 2025, delineates the administration's policy towards AI:\n\n- **Policy Statement**:\n\n  > \"It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\"  \n  > — ([Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence - The White House])\n\n- **Definition of AI**: The order adopts the definition of AI as set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3).\n\n- **Developing an AI Action Plan**: The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) are tasked with developing an action plan within 180 days.\n\n- **Implementation of Order Revocation**: Immediate review and potential suspension of actions taken under the revoked executive order are mandated to eliminate obstacles to the new policy.\n\n### Focus on Eliminating Ideological Bias\n\nThe administration emphasizes the need for AI systems to be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas:\n\n> \"To maintain this leadership, we must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas.\"  \n> — ([Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence - The White House])\n\n### Revision of OMB Memoranda\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is directed to revise relevant memoranda to align with the new policy:\n\n- **OMB Memoranda M-24-10 and M-24-18**: These memoranda, which provide guidance for federal agencies on utilizing and acquiring AI, are to be revised within 60 days.\n\n## Establishment of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)\n\n### Executive Order Establishing PCAST\n\nOn January 23, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order titled **\"President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\"** ([President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology - The White House]), establishing a new advisory council to guide the nation's science and technology policy.\n\n- **Purpose**:\n\n  > \"This order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology.\"  \n  > — ([President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology - The White House])\n\n- **Composition**: The council will comprise up to 24 members, including distinguished individuals from sectors outside the federal government, as well as the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, who will serve as co-chairs.\n\n### Fact Sheet on Launching PCAST\n\nThe White House released a fact sheet titled **\"Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Launches PCAST to Restore American Leadership in Science and Technology\"** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Launches PCAST to Restore American Leadership in Science and Technology - The White House]), highlighting the council's objectives:\n\n- **Renewing American Leadership**: The council aims to spearhead American innovation and competitiveness in critical and emerging technologies.\n\n- **Focus on Excellence**: It emphasizes refocusing science and technology policy on results-driven excellence and merit-based achievement.\n\n- **Building on Past Accomplishments**: The fact sheet notes prior initiatives from President Trump's first administration, such as the American AI Initiative and the National Quantum Initiative.\n\n## Announcements of AI Investments\n\n### $500 Billion Investment in AI Infrastructure\n\nWhile the executive orders do not explicitly mention a $500 billion investment, news analysis indicates that President Trump announced a significant investment in AI infrastructure:\n\n- **Formation of Stargate Joint Venture**: OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle will form a joint venture called **\"Stargate\"** to build data centers and electricity generation facilities for AI development, particularly in Texas.\n\n- **Investment Details**:\n\n  > \"The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.\"  \n  > — (News Analysis)\n\n- **Facilitation Through Emergency Orders**: The project will be facilitated by emergency orders from the President.\n\n### Emphasis on Rapid AI Development\n\nThe administration underscores the urgency of advancing AI technology to maintain global leadership and compete with nations like China.\n\n## Policy Shifts and Implications\n\n### Contrasting Approaches to AI Policy\n\nThe Trump administration's actions represent a departure from the previous administration's approach:\n\n- **Deregulation vs. Responsible AI**:\n\n  - **Trump Administration**: Focuses on deregulation, removing barriers to innovation, and accelerating AI development.\n\n    > \"Removing harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhancing America’s global AI dominance.\"  \n    > — ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Action to Enhance America’s AI Leadership - The White House])\n\n  - **Biden Administration**: Emphasized responsible AI development, safety, and ethical considerations.\n\n    > \"President Donald Trump has revoked former president Joe Biden’s Executive Order (EO) to reduce the risks that Artificial Intelligence (AI) pose to the public and to the nation.\"  \n    > — ([Trump Revokes Biden’s EO on AI, Increasing Risk to Americans - Public Citizen])\n\n### Focus on National Security and Competitiveness\n\nThe Trump administration links AI advancement directly to national security and economic competitiveness:\n\n> \"As our global competitors race to exploit these technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance.\"  \n> — ([President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology - The White House])\n\n### Elimination of \"Ideological Agendas\" in Science\n\nThe administration seeks to remove what it perceives as ideological biases in scientific research and AI systems:\n\n> \"Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method.\"  \n> — ([President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology - The White House])\n\n## Public Reactions\n\n### Response from Public Citizen\n\nIn response to President Trump's revocation of Biden's AI executive order, Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization, issued a statement expressing concern:\n\n> \"The tech libertarian extremists surrounding Trump want to eliminate artificial intelligence regulation not to speed innovation but to boost profits. The rollback of the executive order is a giant handout to Trump’s new techbro friends – paid for by the rest of us.\"  \n> — ([Trump Revokes Biden’s EO on AI, Increasing Risk to Americans - Public Citizen])\n\nPublic Citizen's co-president, Robert Weissman, criticized the move as prioritizing corporate interests over public safety and responsible AI development.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the past week, the executive branch under President Donald J. Trump has undertaken significant actions to reshape the United States' approach to artificial intelligence. By revoking previous policies focused on AI safety and regulation, the administration aims to eliminate what it sees as obstacles to innovation and to assert American dominance in the global AI landscape. The establishment of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reflects a commitment to invigorate science and technology policy with an emphasis on merit-based achievement and competitiveness.\n\nThese developments signal a strategic pivot toward rapid AI advancement, substantial investment in AI infrastructure, and a deregulatory stance intended to expedite technological progress. While proponents argue that such measures are necessary to maintain global leadership and ensure national security, critics express concerns about the potential risks associated with unchecked AI development and the removal of safeguards designed to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI technologies.\n\nAs the United States navigates this new policy direction, the implications for innovation, economic growth, national security, and societal impact will continue to unfold, shaping the landscape of artificial intelligence both domestically and globally."
